0,MartinHafer,Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?!,8/10,22 February 2015,"The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.",Interstellar
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Often impressive and very beautiful, but less than stellar",6/10,21 January 2017,"As someone who likes the cast, loved the concept and who considers Christopher Nolan very talented and has enjoyed a good deal of his films, 'Interstellar' was somewhat of a let-down. It has a lot of great elements, but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution.Starting with the praises, 'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot, seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film, it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity.'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently, with some fascinating ideas, and does have a lot of heart, making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship, which is really what takes centre stage, is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition, strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command.Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke, he holds everything together in a committed, charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive, and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine.However, 'Interstellar' is overlong and, because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it, it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned, there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too.Dialogue isn't a strong suit either, there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant, but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes), forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary, also somewhat silly, while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat.Overall, less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said, 'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically, though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany Cox",Interstellar
2,Leofwine_draca,"Another bloated, overrated space epic",4/10,14 January 2017,"Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight.For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.",Interstellar
3,SnoopyStyle,some problems but a few great touches of 2001,7/10,25 June 2015,"In the near future, Earth is devastated by blight where corn is the only surviving crop. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand.I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently, science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely.Once McConaughey goes up into space, the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally, it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems. Although, I thought he might turn into a space baby at the end.",Interstellar
4,Hitchcoc,"Intellectual, Although Sometimes Flawed Science Fiction",7/10,19 June 2015,"I'm treading on some little used ground. From reading previous user comments, it seems that people give this movie a ten or a one (really?!). While this movie is, at times, a little confusing in the implications of time and space, it is still quite challenging and interesting. Earth is dying. Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently, because of some serious dust, crops are slowly being destroyed. Also, the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess, but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing. There is some preachiness here which I find a bit hard to take, and a couple stated lessons that an eighth grader would know, let alone these experts. But it did keep my interest. One short criticism: It is way too long.

5,Horst_In_Translation,Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best,8/10,25 December 2014,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot.",Interstellar
6,claudio_carvalho,Pretentious and Overrated Trip,6/10,12 April 2015,"In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Interestelar"" (""Interstellar"")",Interstellar
7,nogodnomasters,START PULLING YOUR WEIGHT,7/10,13 November 2018,"Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, a former near astronaut only a daughter (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain) could love. The Earth is dying from...well it is dying so the government rewrites history books to make the space program fictional, apparently attempting to appease right wing audiences and alienate left wingers...but wait, that's just a bad hook.Based on lines in the dust in the library, Cooper discovers a top secret NASA location near his house (built on ""magnetic ore"" ) in farm country. It seems somebody has deliberately placed a wormhole out in space near Saturn that leads us to another galaxy where there are some earth-like planets...maybe. Yes, in this near future world NASA has been able to solve suspended animation and create a ship to transport people to Saturn and beyond, start colonizing planets and be able to send signals back through the wormhole...but they can't green Mars.Now the science behind it is an extrapolation of what we know and believe theoretically, except for maybe that library scene which I found very very hard to swallow, but it was the climax of the film. It was needed to bring the film full circle. Many people will get lost in the science as they toss around terms. Yes, let's send a robot through the event horizon of the black hole so we can get the missing gravitational data we need to fill the gap in our anti-gravity quantum physics calculation...which we can immediately make into something to transport the human population. I had more problem with the practicality of applying the science then the science itself.They go to one planet landed on by Miller. They called it Miller's planet. Then they go to landed on by Mann, apparently it was a Mann's world too. Not to reveal more than the trailer, The question in the film is about how much would an individual sacrifice to save the species in the future. The underlying question screams about how we are killing the planet for the future, but are not willing to sacrifice anything in carbon emissions now. Yes, the theme of the film touches on the modern debate of Global Warming and the sacrifice asked of us to stop it and save the only planet we will ever live on for generations unborn.What are you willing to do to save the world for generations unborn?Worth while view for the science and Omni crowd...others do so at their own risk.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 2 F-bombs for the kids. Thank you Christopher Nolan",Interstellar
8,kosmasp,Out of this world,10/10,31 May 2015,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...

9,classicsoncall,"""We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it.""",8/10,15 November 2014,"Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement"", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.",Interstellar
10,gavin6942,Absolutely Brilliant,9/10,25 January 2015,"A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics.

11,jboothmillard,Interstellar,7/10,11 December 2014,"I saw the poster for this film long before its release, and it was billed to be a big blockbuster, the success of space movie Gravity probably helped the hype, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception). Basically, in the near future Earth is facing the extinction of the human race due to drought, famine and extreme climate change. Widowed former science engineer and NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) and lives with teenage son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and ten year old daughter Murphy ""Murph"" (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn's Mackenzie Foy), she believes her room is haunted, the ""ghost"" she and Cooper discover is communicating through gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in dust. These coordinates direct Cooper to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Sir Michael Caine), there may be hope for the human race to survive; a wormhole, created by alien intelligence, discovered in the further reaches of the solar system, leading to another galaxy, surrounding the black hole Gargantua three potentially habitable worlds have been identified, named Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, after scientists who surveyed them. Cooper is recruited to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to explore these planets, if one of them can sustain life then humanity will follow in space stations, but this means he will be away from home for many years, but this mission is important, Murph is devastated by his departure, they part on bad terms. On Endurance, Cooper is joined by Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), scientists Romilly (Cloud Atlas's David Gyasi) and Doyle (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), and robots TARS (voiced by The Grinch's Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart), the scientists go into hibernation while the craft travels towards the black hole, once close they awake and try to withstand the turbulent effects. The first head to planet Miller, but it being so close to Gargantua means it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: every hour on the surface is seven years on Earth, it is inhospitable, being covered by shallow ocean that experiences enormous tidal waves, Amelia tries to recover data, but Doyle is killed and departure is delayed, returning to the shuttle Cooper and Amelia find 23 years has passed. Back on Earth, adult Murph (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with his equation to enable NASA to launch the massive space station, near death Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined it is an impossible project, he covered this up and put faith in ""Plan B"": using fertilised embryos to start humanity anew, however Murph says the equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. The Endurance only has enough fuel to visit one more planet, after a tense vote they decide Mann is best, however landing they find it is icy and inhospitable, they do however find Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) in hibernation, awoken he tells everything he knows about the mission, he knew ""Plan B"" was the true goal, he faked data to be rescued. In a moment of madness Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, fleeing to Endurance on a shuttle, Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann planted, Amelia rescues Cooper and they get to Endurance, just as Mann docks improperly and causes the airlock to explode, serious damage is caused, but Cooper gets Endurance under control using the shuttle. Nearly out of fuel Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua towards Edmunds, Cooper sacrifices himself with TARS to collect data on the singularity, detaching into the black hole and propelling Amelia by dropping the ship's mass, Cooper and TARS enter an extra-dimensional ""tesseract"", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murph's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realises the alien beings may be human from the future who have constructed this space for him to communicate with Murph and save humanity, the coordinates from previously were in fact Cooper himself, finding adult Murph in the ""tesseract"" he uses gravitational waves to encode TARS's data on the singularity into Murph's watch, with this she solves Brand's equation and the process of evacuating Earth begins, the ""tesseract"" is closed and Cooper ejected from Gargantua back into the Solar System near Saturn. Time dilation from the entire mission means that humans have evolved to become an advanced space faring race, Cooper is found by a space police vehicle before his oxygen level drops, he wakes on-board ""Cooper's Station"", he explores the alternative world, and he reunites with elderly Murph (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who led the exodus of humanity, she advises Cooper and TARS to search for Amelia, who has begun preparation on the planet Edmunds. Also starring Casey Affleck as adult Tom Cooper, Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace as Getty, The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as School Principal and William Devane as Williams. McConaughey holds it together well as the forthright pilot into space, Hathaway is good being informative, Chastain does well as the angry but important daughter, Damon is a welcome surprise, and Caine gets his moments as the wild old man. The majority of the film has similar scale and vision to 2001: A Space Odyssey, utilising fantastic special effects for spectacular visuals and extra-terrestrial worlds, I can see elements of Silent Running as well, it does get soppy towards the end with a concept like Contact (coincidentally also starring McConaughey), but overall it is a majestic space film with plenty to offer, including heart, a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Hans Zimmer, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Original Music, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Very good!",Interstellar
12,Tweekums,A journey across the galaxy to save humanity,9/10,27 January 2016,"Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.",Interstellar
13,BA_Harrison,Disappears up its own black hole.,7/10,10 November 2014,"As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.",Interstellar
14,paul_haakonsen,Great up towards the end...,6/10,28 December 2015,"I finally got around to watching ""Interstellar"" after having been told how good and fantastic this movie was by several people. I will agree with them for the most parts. It is a beautiful movie and it has a captivating storyline. Well, right up to the point where Cooper went into the Black hole. Then it just turned ludicrous.However, from the way I had been told about the story in ""Interstellar"" I had expected a bit more from it. I found it to be a bit too brisk in getting past most of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie.The effects in the movie were really good and came off as being believable, which really worked in favor of the movie, obviously. And the acting was also quite good, even with Matt Damon in it.There are some interesting elements in the storyline, I just wish that Nolan would have put more emphasis on the science and theoretical aspects of the movie's storyline; in regards of black holes, wormholes, relativity theory, etc.All in all, an enjoyable movie for sure, but for me it just wasn't as grand and epic as most people had made it out to be.",Interstellar
15,tavm,Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative,9/10,1 December 2014,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.

16,michaelRokeefe,Absolutely thrilling! A can't miss movie!,9/10,8 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!",Interstellar
17,sunwarrior13,A Tale Of Love And Sacrifice,10/10,10 November 2014,"Interstellar is a science fiction film that tells the story of space travelers that are in search of a new habitable planet in the outer space.The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film.The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clichéd and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace.This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.",Interstellar
18,Theo Robertson,Worm-Holes ? What About Plot Holes ?,4/10,29 March 2015,"One of my all time favourite novels is The Death Of Grass by the late John Christopher . Written in 1956 it tells off a virus that destroys the cereal crops of Asia , Africa and Europe plunging most of humanity in to famine . It was adapted by Cornel Wilde in a 1970 film called NO BLADE OF GRASS , a very bleak and hard hitting film but one that was also painfully disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying . That said the power of the premise is clear to see and one has high hopes it will be remade one day . Along comes Christopher Nolan a director so highly regarded that if he did a selfie on his I-phone then that clip would automatically find itself on the IMDb Top 250 film list and he takes the premise of The Death Of Grass as a plot device and manages to make a film far more unconvincing than Cornel Wilde's movie not t mention far more expensive As I said humanity is being starved in to extinction and live on a diet of corn . Being set in the American mid-West corn is obviously easy to come by but would this be true of other people living on other continents ? I'm not a farmer or a geologist but surely there's a good reason why some countries have a staple diet of wheat while other countries have a staple diet of rice ? Perhaps the countries that no longer can grow wheat now grow root vegetables as their staple diet ? I suppose you've got to join up the dots for yourself but it's rather annoying the way the rest of the world goes unmentioned almost as though the film makers have failed to think the scenario through properly . Especially later where mankind seems to be facing greater dangers from sand storms than famine Some other things the makers haven't thought through with the film In this near future world armies no longer exist ? A noble ideal perhaps but surely if a nation state exists so would an army if only to protect itself from other nation states ? It's official - everyone thinks the Moon landings were faked . I can see Nolan having a dig at creationism being taught in American schools but this ties in with another plot turn NASA still exists as a secretive organization ! Right so the government agency that sent men to the Moon and back exists as a real though somewhat underground organization and yet everyone thinks the Moon landings are faked ? Can't see the logic behind this . It also adds more confusion when ...NASA send the protagonists to a wormhole just off Jupiter . It's never revealed if these space journeys have US government approval but if not why would a government scrap standing armies and not totally shut down an agency that can send people to the ends of the solar system if you're going to teach conspiracy theories in school ? In reality it also be technically and monetary prohibitive for an agency to do this without government approval , Certainly internal logic and continuity is not the films strong point . It's also a film that's over long and contains an ending straight out of the more prentious episodes of SPACE 1999 This is a pity because it's more than competent on a technical level and I can see Nolan is trying to make an intelligent space epic that will try and grab the audiences attention and fire up their passion for real life science . Unfortunately he's left out the intelligence in crafting a drama and when this fails so does everything else",Interstellar
19,preppy-3,"Long, dull and WAY overpraised",1/10,13 November 2014,"A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.",Interstellar
20,LeonLouisRicci,"Sometimes Dull and Overwritten but Worth a ""Watch""",7/10,3 June 2015,"In this Film Director Christopher Nolan can't Decide if He wants to be Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick. He doesn't have the Talent of either but is a Good Filmmaker at times. He was 2 for 3 with the ""Batman Trilogy"", ""Memento"" (2000) was Unique, and has done some other Fine Films. Here, Not so Much.The Overt and Heavy Handed Sentimentality was better Restrained in ""Contact"" (1997). The unnecessarily Complicated and Thick Script reminds of ""Inception"" (2010). It tends to Confuse more than impress.It seems, when Matthew Mcconaughey asked the Director for Motivation He was told to Whisper and Mumble. The other Stars that Show up are OK if Nothing Special, although when Matt Damon wakes it Provides the Film with one of the better Pieces of Space-Drama.There are a few Good Lines...""Humanity was born on Earth but not meant to stay here."" and ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about are place in the dirt."" But the Overwritten Science-Babble and Over-Complicated Plot seems to try and Impress those Viewers that Think that ""The 5th Dimension"" is a Singing Group.A few Interesting and Artistic Scenes that are Outstanding, like the ""Library"" are what makes the Film rise Above Mediocre. But there's a lot of Technological Stuff considering the Time Frame and Events that really are Strange and Bewildering. The Social behavior that got Humans to turn the Planet into a Dust-Bowl isn't Even Mentioned. Gravity, not the Movie, the other thing, is Mentioned Frequently. It's Worth a Watch but is mostly Disappointing and highly Derivative in both Style and Concept. Science-Fiction, Contrary to most Haters of this thing, does not have to Obey Current Knowledge. It can, and often does, come from Made Up Stuff from Creative Minds. Directors and Writers are Free to Explore anything They can Imagine. That's why it is called Science ""Fiction"". So No Problem there.",Interstellar
21,writers_reign,Gone To Earth,6/10,8 November 2014,"I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.",Interstellar
22,zardoz-13,A Sci-Fi Masterpiece,10/10,25 November 2014,"Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.",Interstellar
23,grantss,A sci-fi epic,8/10,24 November 2014,"An epic science fiction movie. Not just epic due to its running time - about 2 3/4 hours - but also due to its physical scale and the boldness of its concepts. Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times. The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff. Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding. Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose. The conclusion ties up many loose ends and/or justifies some of the flat moments, but not all.",Interstellar
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Very nearly out-of-this-world,8/10,8 November 2014,"With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10",Interstellar
25,george.schmidt,Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,9/10,12 November 2014,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!",Interstellar
26,neil-476,Far too long and self-important,7/10,14 November 2014,"Weather stuff is messing up crops on Earth, and we're all going to suffocate from too much nitrogen. Secret NASA is exploring potentially habitable worlds via a wormhole provided by 5 dimensional aliens, and ace pilot Cooper goes on one such exploratory mission despite the pleas of his daughter for him not to. The mission does not go according to plan.This film, directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother, is going to make Nolan fans cream their jeans They are, after all, a vociferous bunch, and they tend to think of him as a cinematic deity. Me – not so much. I have enjoyed his films, but I also think they are very flawed, and Interstellar is no exception.It is a very derivative film, with so much borrowed from 2001 and 2010 that you are constantly expecting robot TARS to turn against the crew members. The main story is OK (if somewhat familiar) but the resolution, even though decked out with pseudo-science gobbledegook, still reeks of plot expediency rather than scientific verisimilitude. And it is far, far too long – there is an entire sequence featuring an unexpected well-known face which could have been replaced with a 30-second alternative, and nothing of any narrative significance would have been lost. This is not a well-paced film although, on a single viewing, it does hold the interest. However, at nearly 3 hours, it could usefully lose an hour of running time.It contains good performances, visuals which are interesting if somewhat less spectacular than I would have hoped for, silence in space (hooray!), a character played by child and adult performers who actually look like each other and – surprisingly for Nolan – some genuine emotion.This isn't a bad film, but it has far too high an opinion of itself.",Interstellar
27,evanston_dad,Is Christopher Nolan Ever Going to Make Another Good Movie?,5/10,3 December 2014,"OK, time for me to turn in my Christopher Nolan card.Ever since ""Memento,"" I've been waiting for Christopher Nolan to make another film that isn't a big hot mess, and it seems I will be waiting forever. He comes up with terrific conceits that clearly make sense to him, but he simply cannot translate them to the screen and make them intelligible to anyone else. ""Interstellar"" is his latest load of hooey, nearly three hours of sci-fi mumbo jumbo queasily married to a sentimental father/daughter drama. It goes on forever and includes all manner of tangents that a more concise writer or editor (anybody, please!) would have excised. Indeed, Nolan's biggest failing as a writer/director is that he can't seem to get his thoughts organized, and every movie he makes feels like a rough draft that no one ever got around to assembling into a coherent narrative. To give him credit, ""Interstellar"" isn't anywhere nearly as incoherent as ""The Prestige"" or ""Inception,"" and it's not as leadenly humorless and self-important as ""The Dark Knight,"" but it's just as exasperating as all of those other movies in its tendency to start with a good concept that it then buries under a heap of directorial self indulgence.I learned a long time ago to simply stop going to see Oliver Stone or Spike Lee movies when I realized that neither was ever going to make a good movie, and I guess I now have to add Nolan to that dubious list.Grade: C",Interstellar
28,view_and_review,When Earth Can No Longer Be Your Home,7/10,9 June 2015,"One thing about Interstellar that is undeniable--it is a long movie. At 2 and a half hours you'd better strap in for the long haul. And with the musical score the movie is like one long piano concerto. There was not a moment too trivial for a portentous musical moment.Interstellar is about time, space and saving humanity. All three of these items are connected. In the near future man is on the brink of extinction because nothing will grow. The only viable solution is to leave Earth behind and start anew on a new planet. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) volunteers to pilot an extremely risky mission to another galaxy in search of mankind's new home.This movie involves science, astronomy, physics, and a lot of other high level stuff that makes people like me say ""whoa you guys are smart."" In between all of that were strong messages about love and family and unbreakable bonds. At times the movie was down right depressing and at other times it was uplifting and at all times it seemed to try to pull tears out of you.This movie had elements of so many movies before it: Contact, Signs, Abyss, Elysium but it never truly mimicked anyone of them. If you watch this movie, be prepared for several recognizable appearances from known actors and be prepared to weep.",Interstellar
29,AlsExGal,Good but a bit long,8/10,12 August 2018,"This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out ""What's in your safe?""The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors.",Interstellar
30,ferguson-6,Rave at Close of Day,7/10,16 November 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. There are probably three distinct groups that view this as a ""must see"" movie. First, there are the hardcore science lovers – especially those dedicated to space and time. Next would be the core group of Sci-Fi aficionados (those who quote and debate the specifics of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc). And finally, those cinephiles who anxiously await the next ground-breaking film of director Christopher Nolan, whose experimental and pioneering methods are quite unique in today's Hollywood.Given that I would be laughed out of the first two groups – exposed as less than a neophyte, you may assume that my discussion of this film will not be steeped in scientific or astrophysical theorem. Instead, this will provide my reaction to what has been one of my two most anticipated films of the year (Birdman being the other).Simply stated, the look of this film is stunning and breath-taking. Its theatrical release comes in many formats, and I chose 70mm. This made for an incredibly rich look with probably the best sound mix I have ever heard. The physical sets were remarkable and as varied as the scene settings: a farm house, a NASA bunker, multiple spacecrafts, and numerous planets. Beyond that, we experienced the effects of blackholes, wormholes and the tesseract. Mr. Nolan's long time cinematographer and collaborator Wally Pfister was off directing his own film (Transcendence), so the very talented Hoyt Van Hoytema joined the team and contributed sterling camera work, including the first ever hand-held IMAX shots. Top this off with Hans Zimmer's complimentary (though sometimes manipulative) score, and Mr. Nolan has produced a technical marvel of which known adjectives lack justice.Take note of the exceptional cast led by the reigning Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club), and other Oscar winners and nominees Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, and Ellen Burstyn. Beyond these, we also have David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, William Devane, Topher Grace, David Gyasi, Collette Wolfe, Timothy Chalamet, and an exceptionally fine performance from Mackenzie Foy (who will forever be remembered as the Twilight child of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson).On the downside, I found myself shocked at some of the dubious and distracting dialogue. At times, the conversations were contradictory and even seemed out of place for the situation, character and movie. In particular, the entire Matt Damon sequence and the Anne Hathaway monologue on ""love"" both struck me as disjointed and awkward. These and other minor annoyances can't be discussed here without noting key plot points, so that's where we will leave it. However, it must be mentioned that the words of Dylan Thomas are so oft repeated, that the phrase ""Do not go gently into that good night"" can now be officially considered fighting words.The works of noted Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne were the inspiration for the story, and even Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has come out in support of much of the science in the film. Be prepared for brain strain on topics such as space-time continuum (Einstein's Relative Study of Time), gravity, and the aforementioned wormholes, blackholes and tesseracts. The blight depicted in the first hour draws its look and even some closed circuit interviews directly from Ken Burns' documentary The Dust Bowl (2012). Beyond all of the science and lessons of human arrogance and survival, I found the story to be focused on loss  loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of hope  and balanced by the remarkable human survival instinct. Christopher Nolan deserves much respect for addressing these human emotions and desires with the overwhelming vastness of space, and doing so in a time when Hollywood producers would much rather financially back the next superhero or even a sequel to a 20 year old comedy.",Interstellar
31,anaconda-40658,Depressing but Visually Stunning.,8/10,25 December 2015,"Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time. Glorious special effects are out of this world creating what science only dreams of. Score: 8 / 10",Interstellar
32,AaronCapenBanner,Time & Space,7/10,3 April 2015,"Christopher Nolan directed this sprawling, ambitious science fiction film set in the near-future that stars Mathew McConaughey as a pilot turned farmer named Cooper, forced into that life when famine and blight ravage the earth, compelling humankind to turn away from exploration, even concocting revisionist history that gets his daughter Murphy in trouble at school, but soon their lives will be dramatically altered when he is recruited in a top secret mission headed by Dr. Brand(played by Michael Caine) which will see him team up with Brand's daughter(played by Anne Hathaway) on a dangerous mission into a wormhole that just may save the human race, if they make it back in time...Big ideas at work here, and Nolan's direction is superb, as are the performances, though this story doesn't seem to know when to quit, becoming a bit far-fetched at the climax, but still remains an impressive endeavor nonetheless. Will require multiple viewings.

33,phd_travel,"Spectacular, deafening, partly comprehensible",7/10,6 November 2014,"The good points first. Liked it better than the other Nolan flicks: Inception and Transendence. The story is better. The first half with the start of the mission is quite moving and believable as the environmental catastrophe is quite plausible nowadays. There is some connection to the characters emotionally. The cast is as stellar as the title with a still gaunt Matthew with an inappropriate drawl, unlikely scientist Professor Anne Hathaway, lovely daughter played by Mackenzie Foy of Breaking Dawn and later the not seen enough Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine as Professor senior. The planetarium like space scenes are beautiful, realistic and spectacular. Going to the other planets was fascinating. Thank goodness no monsters and other aliens.The faults are as spectacular as the plus points. The soundtrack is deafening and cuts out dialog. For no good reason the music blasts cutting out dialog in many scenes. It's like being stuffed in a Cathedral Organ while it is being played. The second half of the movie with the time relativity stuff and saving the planet is partly incomprehensible. I concentrated but still didn't understand why one hour would be 7 years. The ""stay"" thing just isn't explained well nor how the planet was saved with the information. Matt Damon isn't a good ""villain"" at all. Bad choice.Overall it's worth a watch because it's just so grand and part of it is makes sense. At least can understand the broad picture. Just be prepared for some bewilderment and bring ear plugs.",Interstellar
34,deloudelouvain,Stunning sci-fi !,9/10,19 April 2015,"Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years.

35,SimonJack,Updated Space Odyssey is the best space sci-fi of the new century so far,7/10,8 August 2017,"As of 2017, ""Interstellar"" is the best sci-fi space film of the 21st century. It was nearly 50 years since the first major film involving time travel and crossing dimensions in space. I wondered when someone would again pick up on the idea presented in the 1968 blockbuster, ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""Interstellar"" has that and more. It holds one's interest, even though the premise for the dying, over- populated earth was outmoded by the early 21st century. Low birth rates in all of the developed countries are projected to lead to population declines. Deaths will outpace births in most countries well before the mid-21st century. This is a departure from the more common alien creatures of sci-fi films. I do enjoy those type of films more. They are no more far- fetched than the notions of traveling back or forward in time. This film does a good job of trying to put credence to many theories. But, the film's ""science"" about time dilation, quantum gravity and wormholes is probably over the heads of 99.99 percent of viewers. One of the nice things about sci-fi is that it doesn't have to make sense. Aspects can be outlandish, bizarre and inconceivable. After all, that's what makes it fictional in the realm of science. The cast in this film all give good performances. The space scenes are very good as are all technical aspects and production values of the movie. I don't rate it any higher than seven because it doesn't provide the excitement or edge of seat anxiety that other sci-fi films provide. One should never take these films, or their plots too seriously. They are entertaining fiction, period.",Interstellar
36,siderite,Another Nolan ego trip,7/10,25 December 2014,"If you are one of those people that thought Inception was a really good movie and it made a whole lot of sense, then stop reading this review; you will not agree with it.Interstellar is a movie that I have been waiting for a long time, ever since they released teasers and trailers and a lot of science blogs started talking about it. I held myself away from such discussions, though, because I wanted to have an open mind when I watched it. My verdict: really well done movie that made absolutely no sense, in any number of dimensions. People said that it was inspiring; if it inspires anyone, that's good, but don't come crying to me when they come back disappointed that they cannot hear the symphonic music and the BWAAAAANG in space, like they expected it.I really don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. It took a mere 15 minutes for me to start gritting my teeth and it only became worse as time went by for the entire three hour length of this space sham. Prepare yourselves for Nolan's attempt at a Space Odyssey 2001, only with more special effects and no understanding of science whatsoever. It hits all the right emotional buttons and, indeed, if you have the intelligence of a dog, you will love this film at the level that they are so loving towards their masters.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role, all the supporting actors are great, visual effects are good, even if unnecessarily over the top, all the little details are well taken care of... all except a script that makes any sense beyond ""Oh, love, boo hoo!"".Bottom line: my head hurts with angry disappointment. I am at fault for expecting so much from this movie. Another eye candy ego trip from a director that thinks too highly of himself.",Interstellar
37,namashi_1,"Stellar, Indeed!",9/10,8 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan's much awaited 'Interstellar' is Stellar, Indeed! Nolan takes us to space & beyond, delivering a film that's both, astounding & futuristic. Made unfathomable ambition & force, this Sci-Fi/Family-Drama, deserves a watch for the experience it gives you as a viewer & also a human being.'Interstellar' Synopsis: A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.'Interstellar' raises questions on the future & on what maybe the fate of mankind after all. Jonathan & Chris Nolan's Screenplay fills in all the scientific punches to lead it in, that eventually, is more a tale of a father & his daughter. 'Interstellar' proudly captures the strong bond of family-bond, that we all experience & relate too in our lives. The portions back home on earth are wonderfully executed. The Sci-Fit bit, however, is stunning & equally captivating. The twist & turns in the narrative, featuring a surprise cameo Matt Damon, only keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next. Its purely edge-of-the-seat rush.Chris Nolan's Direction is gargantuan, just like the film's scale. Nolan handles this important story with care & style. Each & Every Visual has been filmed amazingly by Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. You can't look away from the Screen for a single moment! Lee Smith's Editing is pretty crisp, despite the film's mammoth length, which goes on for more than 168-minutes. Hans Zimmer's Score is exhilarating. Visual Effects are Oscar-Worthy. Performance-Wise: Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, delivers a heartfelt performance. The Oscar-Winning Actor is the soul of this epically structured film. Anne Hathaway as Amelia, is perfect in her portrayal. Jessica Chastain as Murphy, Cooper's long suffering daughter, is splendid. Her emotional breakdowns tear you apart. Wes Bentley as Doyle, is effective. Casey Affleck as Tom, is nicely restrained. John Lithgow as Donald, is subtly funny. Michael Caine as Professor Brand, is dignified, as ever. On the whole, 'Interstellar' is not merely a film, its an Experience. Heavily Recommended!",Interstellar
38,StevePulaski,Embodies the reason why many of us venture to the cinema,8/10,10 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" combines two of the most basic principles of science-fiction stories, simultaneously being tense and immersing, but also manages to be somewhat perplexing in its manipulation of space and time. In that simple respect, the film is nearly a wash, but thanks to Nolan's desire to constantly challenge and experiment with how far the realms of science-fiction filmmaking can go, he manages to concoct another crafty and commendable film that effectively compliments his decorated filmography.Coming off of his acclaimed ""Batman"" trilogy, and his beloved mindbender ""Inception,"" Nolan further explores the concept of time manipulation with ""Interstellar."" Set in the near future, we are greeted with an ugly America, reliant on agriculture and burdened by prolific and crippling dust storms that make life, human and agricultural, incredibly difficult and almost impossible. We focus on the family of a widowed-man named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who lives in a ramshackle farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow), his teenage son Tom, and his ten-year-old daughter Murphy. Cooper, a man with a passion for science and engineering, discovers moving books on his book shelf that are ostensibly the work of a paranormal entity. After dust is seen rising from his floor and spells out a message of a secret NASA institution, Cooper realizes it is a route of communication from an undetermined world or dimensional.Cooper arrives at the secret NASA institution, led by one of his old professors (Michael Caine), who informs him that a wormhole has been discovered in the solar system and exists near Saturn. He states that a team of astronauts need to go into space and venture through the wormhole in order to explore new galaxies and potentially find a new place for humans to call home. Now that Cooper has seen this institution, there's no turning back, and he must embark on an intergalactic mission with numerous others, leaving his family behind for an unknown amount of time. Being that many of these galaxies exist in the realm of time that moves either progressively faster or slower than what we've come to know, spending an hour in one particular location could warrant seven years have slipped by back on Earth.Before we go any further, ""Interstellar,"" seems to be a modern reimagining or homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Cooper meets a unique looking robot by the name of TARS soon after he embarks on the mission, who doesn't look or operate anything like the conventional, humanoid robots we've come to imagine and sounds very similar to the computer system HAL from the aforementioned film. In addition, interactions with relatives who Cooper hasn't seen in years, the exploration of different galaxies, the impending commentary on scientific advancement and how far we've come, and even the adventure through the wormhole that reminds one of the scene in the classic film where the ship travels through the hyperspace all remind of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" With that, it's almost as if Nolan wanted to bring about an entirely more scientific angle to the story rather than one predicated on metaphors and interpretations.For that reason, expecting ""Interstellar"" to be entirely original and unforeseen is foolish mainly because basic elements of the story seem to have been stripped from ""2001"" in such a way that renders them, not as lesser, but familiar. However, make no mistake in recognizing the true beauty that the film manages to summon almost on command. ""Interstellar"" is a gorgeous film, with Oscar-worthy special effects that find themselves immersing the viewer in different worlds and different places that are only limited by the imagination of the Nolan brothers, Christopher and Jonathan, and the impeccably-talented special effects artists who brought them to life. One of the basic principles of filmmaking is achieved here as Nolan and a devoted crew of special effects artist effectively transport us to different galaxies and cater to our unquenchable thirst for visions of the universe.At the center of all of this is McConaughey, who I'm not afraid to call my favorite leading male actor working today, along the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey, Jr., and Channing Tatum. McConaughey has effectively transformed himself into an actor of range and impeccable talent, with ""Interstellar"" being his most emotional project yet. McConaughey exhausts himself by circling all the emotional bases this particular story can offer, working best when his character is forced to watch his kids grow twenty-three years older in five minutes, creating the saddest scene in the whole film. It's the kind of performance where you almost feel that the Academy cannot wait to announce his name as one of the nominees for Best Actor.""Interstellar""'s crowning achievement, besides its special effects work, is its human-centeredness, keeping the human characters in mind every step of the project. Even with grandiose ideas about existence and time etched into the screenplay, Nolan never loses sight of believable human drama and the real heartbreak in seeing your children age from, literally, another galaxy. ""Interstellar,"" even in a state that feels like an homage crossed with an extremely-ambitious tale of space and time, is a film that caters to the basic idea of why we go to the movies as a medium of entertainment.",Interstellar
39,DKosty123,Quality Sci-Fi,9/10,29 November 2014,"The effects on this one remind me of Kubrick some how. Earth is in major trouble and some folks have to go into space to save the human race. While this type of plot has been done before, this approach seems fresh and realistic. That is because real (scientists ) were hired to consult on the film. It gives a major upgrade to this movie over some other recent films where this plot was used.So the reference to the government altering school books because they faked the Apollo missions to the moon might be a bit far fetched, but there are fans of Kubick who insist he filmed the real moon sequences in the 1960's meaning they are not real. There are some realistic scenes on earth here with farms and problems threatening earth. Michael Caine is here as the planner of the space mission of 3 years to try and save the earth. This is not a perfect planet, but you pretty much figure out we have to help each other to save it but strange leaders are preventing that.It is amusing when Caine finds out late in the movie that a lot of his work was off because he might have focus on the wrong theory all his life. All to true and much too often in the real world.",Interstellar
40,lasttimeisaw,it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan!,9/10,22 November 2014,"By no means I am a scientific geek, my days of tackling with science has been fortuitously truncated years ago, so putting aside all these heatedly discussed astrological concepts, to be specific, wormhole, black hole, tesseract, the fifth dimension and time travel relativity (thanks to the enormous contribution of Dr. Kip Thorne), INTERSTELLAR is a potent analogue of Nolan's previous stunning visual and conceptual extravaganza INCEPTION (2010, 9/10), which looks deep into the bizarre inner activity within one's dream realm, but this time, Nolan's scope is going the opposite direction, extended outwardly to the unknown universe and based on a more perceivable future of the earth's imminent doom (we are all the culprits of various degrees in this scenario), it is not just an awe-inspiring outer-space odyssey, in its dual storyline, the life on earth is phenomenally linked by human's primitive force - love. I didn't watch the film on an IMAX screen, which in Cairo is quite scarce, and Cairo is a big city, but I have no gripe to watch it on a normal 2D screen since it is fantastically overwhelming just the same. In the pre-space trip , ex-pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (McConaughey) is staying with his two children, Murph, short for Murphy (Foy) and Tom (Chalamet) with his father-in-law Donald (Lithgow), while their world is experiencing extreme weather catastrophe such as sand storms, the father-and-daughter bond between Cooper and Murph has been intensified through their similar attitude towards science and the supernatural episodes happened in Murph's room, where she claims there is a ""phantom"" using gravity to send her messages, which is such an ingenuous yet inconspicuous maneuver to foreshadows the mind-blowing twist in the black hole, and unthinkably it becomes the key to save all the humanity on earth. The emotional crunches are prepped with incredible performance, again, McConaughey is unbelievably trans-formative as the loving father who decide to reunite with Murph and keep his promises against all odds, his supreme reaction shots when reading messages for the past 23 years from Tom and Murph on earth are his Oscar-baiting moments, it seems the McConaussance has not been slowing down and one Oscar statue seems not enough at all. Mackenzie Foy plays the young Murph, Chastain is her adult version and Burstyn gives the final happy ending as the senior one. Chastain is a relentless fireball, formidably interprets the most arcane part (the telepathic revelation of who is the phantom?) which sometimes even challenges its own credibility, it is not a showy role for Chastain's caliber, nevertheless she is excellent in it, take one example, the minute facial nuances when Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) telling her the disturbing truth in his deathbed are handled with almost undetectable forbearance yet viewers can maximally sense the repercussions since it shakes all her belief in one second. Foy is equally brilliant as the young Murph, she sets a solidified base with Cooper, which sustains the mainstay of the film's critical emotional core and guides us through the transcendent experiences with Cooper, and a new child star is officially born. Hathaway's Brand, although second billed, surprisingly doesn't have too much to offer as the co-pilot, sometimes even becomes a corny nuisance (poor Wes Bentley!), there is another type of father-daughter undercurrent (she and Caine) which the film largely dodges. During Cooper's expedition to find suitable planet for earthlings, there is the punned ""Murphy's Law"" effect subsequently occurs, Matt Damon's classified cameo is well-kept from the trailer and his appearance further cements his recent string of involvement with Sci-Fi genre (after THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU 2011, 6/10, ELYSIUM, 2013, 7/10 and Terry Gilliam's THE ZERO THEOREM 2013, next year he will be in Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN with Chastain), his Dr. Mann is the revered pioneer in the project, however it is through him, Nolan builds the only real villain (arguably Caine the big fat liar is condemnable as well), who succumbs to human frailties under the extreme condition, his motive is understandable, any of us could make the same move under his condition, that's why the film is so precious, one has to overcome all the innate barriers to achieve something extraordinary, say without this commitment with Murph, without the uninhibited love for her daughter (poor Tom, his father never even mention him at all), maybe Plan B is the future for human race, and the cruelty is freshly in our face. After GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), we reach a new monumental peak for the cosmic cinematography, pairing with a new DP Hoyte Van Hoytema (from HER 2013, 8/10; TINKER TAILER SOLIDER SPY 2011, 6/10, THE FIGHTER 2010, 8/10 and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008, 9/10), Nolan's galactic wonders are sufficiently groundbreaking, the three planets they visit bear simplistic topography grafted with inconceivable excesses, and the final homeland, the distorted proportion, all evokes the striking variations in INCEPTION. And if Alfonso Cuarón can win BEST DIRECTOR for GRAVITY, Nolan is much more deserving, I am firmly standing behind Nolan's back this, it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan dares to make these ""impossible and grand venture"" to enlighten our imagination and edify our own consciousness as a human being in this imperfect world, with the prowess of love we all possess, however small we are individually, there is hope always beckoning, eternally.",Interstellar

42,OllieSuave-007,Not very stellar.,5/10,29 March 2015,"Matthew McConaughey stars as space traveler Cooper, who travels to space through a wormhole in an attempt to find a planet that will be fitting for humanity to survive, as it is predicted that Earth will be inhabitable due to disasters.This movie combines sci-fi adventures, fantasy elements and spiritual references, which make the plot pretty interesting. It also contains an all-star case including McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Topher Grace and Matt Damon. However, the slow plot momentum and lack of action rendered the movie pretty boring. I first watched this film on a plane ride and fell asleep on it.The visual effects were great, the acting was OK and the concept was pretty intriguing. However, the slow pacing really dragged the movie on. I may be the minority in the opinions, but I've seen more exciting sci-fi/adventures movies.Grade C-",Interstellar
43,sddavis63,Overly Long With Little Real Purpose Or Meaning,4/10,1 November 2015,"It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun) just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest United States struggling along with his family to survive in some future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for humanity.I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand (Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann (Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to ""2001"": particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission had accomplished much of anything.The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them (see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental, yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile. (4/10)",Interstellar
44,Hellmant,Isn't quite as great as I was hoping.,10/10,7 November 2014,"'INTERSTELLAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)Christopher Nolan's new $165 million budgeted sci-fi epic about a team of explorers that travel across space, through a newly discovered wormhole, in an attempt to find a more habitable planet for humanity to live on; after all resources on Earth are nearly destroyed, by drought and famine. It was directed by Nolan and written by him and his brother Jonathan (the two have teamed together on many scripts for Christopher Nolan films). It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Topher Grace, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Caine (plus a few other surprise celebrity cameos, if you don't check IMDb). I think it's a breathtakingly beautiful and impressively ambitious film but it isn't quite as great as I was hoping, even so.The story begins in the near future, when mankind is desperately trying to produce more agricultural resources; due to natural disaster (like mainly huge dust storms) depleting most of what we had. A secret NASA intelligence base, lead by Professor Brand (Caine), has discovered a wormhole that can quickly lead space travelers to other uncharted planets. They hope to send a team of experts through the wormhole, in an attempt to find a planet suitable to live on and colonize (saving humanity). Brand recruits Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot, into leading the mission; when he mysteriously stumbles across their hidden base. Cooper is reluctant to leave his family behind, especially his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), but he knows it's the only way to possibly save them. The scientific aspects of the story are pretty complex and hard to follow (for me at least) but I think with repeat viewing I'll understand the movie a lot more (it took me at least two or three viewings to fully get 'INCEPTION'). For that reason, plus it's nearly three hour running length, it is very slow and feels really long in places. It's visually stunning and always emotionally involving and interesting (even if you can't always understand what's going on). The acting is all great, especially McConaughey (his character is by far the most developed); he, and his costars, do bring a lot more depth to the film (than just the Nolans possibly could). Like a lot of classic sci-fi it gets really philosophical in the end; attempting to explore really broad elements of love and life that science never has been able to, but that's what I especially liked about it. Nolan does an amazing job presenting the material; even if he's a lot more focused on telling a broader and more emotionally complex story this time around, rather than stunning people constantly with action and quick pacing. It's definitely memorable and one not to be missed (especially if you're a Christopher Nolan or sci-fi movie fan).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/BjKuYpFJY8M",Interstellar
45,cherold,"Some interesting ideas, but overall unsatisfying",6/10,13 March 2015,"I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.) The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments. Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.",Interstellar
46,FeastMode,GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,10/10,1 July 2019,"I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. perfection. mind blowing. a workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. amazingly unbelievably awesome, this is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. lots of amazing scenes with epic music. a killer story told flawlessly. perfect directing by the best ever. great cast with great acting. a deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.the most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time I've watched it. I keep picking up on more things in the movie, and understanding better overall. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling. (8 viewings, 2/26/2020)

i was randomly thinking about interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. i thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the future ppl machine is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. if plan B was what ""originally"" happened and dr. brand survived, future ppl figured it out, and they want to save the ppl they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = cooper and murph. doctor brand knows this because she knows cooper loves her, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows his daughter grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future ppl put the machine in the same black hole that cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, i like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory i had about the ""original"" mission being completed without cooperlots of awesome concepts that made me think, like murphy's law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. the robots were cool and original. really awesome visuals of things i've wondered about but never really imagined. i liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughters room. the way everything connected was very awesome. the different planets were so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. the endings were perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time was the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his daughter. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother. The relationship between the father and daughter was the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie was the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needed to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people of the earth. She found out that they knew that they were never gonna come back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste . that should break a person. murph is a beast-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data-They got the best theoretical physicist expert in cosmology to keep the movie honest. And a retired astronaut who's been to space as a technical consultant.-Like I said before, the prevalent underlying theme is the love between a father and daughter which ends up making it possible to save the people on earth. Love is a quantifiable force that transcends time and space.12/2/16 text to malik: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking back onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann owned them. It actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to dr. Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmunds Planet which was the right one anyways. in that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet.",Interstellar
47,Robert_duder,This is either sci-fi brilliance or a melodramatic self-promotion...I'm on the fence,8/10,24 November 2014,"Do you remember when Chris Nolan wasn't CHRIS NOLAN!! Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were amazing examples of redefining old material and creating a world as profoundly unique as Tim Burton did in the 90's. Memento and Inception are two of the smartest, most profound films I have ever seen. But what happened with the Dark Knight Trilogy is Nolan had been stroked so much that he thinks he can do anything. He thinks everything he touches is gold and that isn't quite true. Now all that being said I am so completely confused as to whether Interstellar is yet another example of his sheer brilliance as a film maker and creative mind or if its just him thinking he's great and carbon copying other material to make some sort of deeply profound sci-fi films. It did definitely have some plot holes (though not nearly to the extent of The Dark Knight Rises or Man Of Steel) but a lot of that can be explained away using hypothetical science. It is not exactly your typical mainstream sci-fi film because it is definitely thought provoking but then you think about it too much and the film starts to lose merit. The characters for the most part are surface deep and while the film is visually stunning (as far as I'm concerned its ten times the over-hyped Gravity was visually and story wise) the story makes sense and goes from being a little out there to total science fiction/hypothetical physics.) There is a lot to like about Interstellar and to call it epic is an understatement. Nolan inflates his content to the point where there is so much good and so much bad that you're left confused as to whether you loved it or hated it so I think most people want to love it.Who is a hotter star right now than Matthew McConaughey? Not many! I wouldn't call him my favourite actor by any means but I definitely enjoy him. He has an undeniable star quality on screen. Many reviewers call his performance as brilliant mind/astronaut turned farmer a little laid back and perhaps it is. Does that bother me? No. He still gives a very emotionally charged performance and he is believable in his role. He is a commanding presence and he is good at it. Although some reviewers speak highly of her performance I was a little disappointed with Anne Hathaway...only a little. She is certainly one of my favourite actors and as many have pointed out she is very emotional in this film. She cries...a lot. She is believable in her role and she is very stoic and almost brooding at times but she has reason to be and like McConaughey she just has this amazing chemistry on screen. The two of them together are okay. Its not a romantic relationship which is fine but I think I still expected just a little more chemistry between them. Mackenzie Foy is brilliant as the young daughter ""Murph."" Her brief scenes are some of the best and she is really great at it. The supporting cast are all decent including the always amazing John Lithgow, Michael Caine (who was okay in his role but a far step down from his usual gravitas performances), Casey Affleck (a character that was left very underdeveloped in the big picture...and another supporting role by a surprise actor who I had no idea was in the film. Don't look!! Don't find out unless you already have because its kind of a nice surprise and in today's day and age you don't get a lot of surprises. He is also quite good in a very different role for him. And Jessica Chastain...oh my evil little nemesis. I can't stand her. Her entire persona in any film drives me insane. I don't know what it is. Her look, her voice, her acting...literally my most hated star in Hollywood. And yet critics rave about her every time and they do the same in this. Well I can say without too much bias that she was actually okay in this. There I said it. Believe it or not. She is tolerable and gives a decent performance. She doesn't have a huge role but she shows the proper range for the part. I also give hats off to Nolan and his team for bringing Tars and Case to life...the two robotic entities that are major players in the story. Both of them are terrific and add a little bit of appropriate humour, some great action and are sure to be memorable by future generations as much as other famous robots.I'm not sure I've ever seen Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and yet as I was watching this I felt like that was exactly what he was channelling/copying. Maybe that's okay but it just really kept reminding me of that and Nolan deserves to be known for his own style and world. I would have also liked some more depth to the world that they lived in and what was happening to the earth. My biggest beef with the film though is how it ends. Yes it wraps up nicely and everything makes sense and its not ambiguous like Inception was but there was a glaring plot hole to me. After everything they go through out there in space...they learn nothing. There is no information that they bring back and give to earth. So how do they ""save"" humanity? Just a thought to ponder. The truth of the matter is I wasn't disappointed. It was thought provoking, visually impressive, beautifully made...perhaps a little (or a lot) more melodramatic than it needed to be but it is what it is. Fans of smart science fiction will love it and the rest of the world will like it or hate it or be somewhere in the middle. It wasn't an Oscar contender for me but I'm glad I saw it. 8/10",Interstellar
48,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A once promising director assaults his audience with a seemingly never-ending barrage of bafflement,4/10,6 September 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the future, Earth has become a pretty sad, desolate place, where resources have run scarce and machines have taken over much. A space time continuum in outer space is discovered, around the planet of Saturn, that humanity can ascend to in order to begin a new life away from the rapidly diminishing Earth. Cooper (a continually, frustratingly mumbling Matthew McConaughey) a simple farmer, is chosen to man the space craft that will save Earth, along with co pilots Romilly (David Gyasi) and Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a talking robot thing that looks like a fridge, by the name of TARS (Bill Irwin.) But as the mission unfolds, they discover secrets and lies that threaten to plunge them into conflict amongst each other, I guess. They're possibly meant to do something else, and something else happens, but by the end (which, given the length, I'm surprised I stuck around till), the whole film had just so gone over my head I might have missed it.At the start of the new century, a young, promising director called Christopher Nolan emerged, an eager and hungry young mind that delivered Memento, an intelligent and original thriller that took a far flung concept and played with your mind and demanded your full attention to the end. He followed this with Insomnia, not only one of my all time favourite thrillers, but also one of my favourite films, that I still love to this day. After these two relatively independent offerings, he established himself as one of the top new names, and possibly Hollywood was happy to throw a lot of cash at him, and let him run wild and indulge his darkest, most inner most relentless cerebral musings, and from here on in, he went and delivered increasingly lengthy productions that bombarded the minds of his audience with so much anomaly and detail, even turning Batman into a challenging and complex ride three times. Even his comparatively short 2006 effort The Prestige seemed lost in it's own mystery and aggrandisement. But with Interstellar, he's just completely surpassed himself.Clocking up at nearly three hours, the film, in the time you spend with it (and you really do have to make quite a commitment) truly rakes up every last second of it's stated running time, and that would mean there's a lot to be taken in, and much you might have to describe and re-live about it afterwards. It could be quite difficult, but actually you can sum the film Interstellar up with one word: over. It's over ambitious, over indulgent, over bloody long!, over bearing, over cerebral over complicated and, just over whelming. And by the end, after grudging with it for so long, you'll be glad it's 'over.' Seriously, if you manage to get through it with out getting up to stretch your legs at least once while it's still on, you should get a telegram from the queen! I can't believe it took me so long to see it, but I'm certainly glad I missed it in the cinema.An intelligent concept is fine, but it can't give the audience no room to breathe like this. It's a shame, because if Nolan had delivered something a little more condensed, the intricate plot the film had to explore and any intelligent message it had to deliver could have been better absorbed by the viewer, instead of being lost in a sea of bafflement. Sadly, the best praise I can end up giving it is some fabulous cinematography, in space and at sea that sticks in the mind.Inception was too much, really, but I took it as the most intellectual film ever made and kind of have a soft spot for it, but this is just too much. Nolan can be thankful his films haven['t lost their spark and edge like fellow contemporary M Night Shyamalan, but he really needs to stop being so ruthlessly anti-mainstream and pelting his audience with such lengthy, cerebral exposition, or he might lose them forever. And stop least stop making them so dour and humourless to boot. In terms of a modern, space bound adventure, it goes without saying Alfonso Couran's much trimmer Gravity does a better job of being smart and in orbit. **",Interstellar
49,Lejink,Interstellar Underdrive,4/10,28 August 2018,"I understand that director / producer Christopher Nolan was reaching for a sort of genre-busting, cross-cultural, auteur-imprint sci-fi blockbuster like ""2001"" or ""Close Encounters"" and so establish himself in the cinematic firmament alongside the likes of Kubrick and Spielberg. Well I'll start by saying that those two particular films are far from my favourites by Stan and Steve and that I struggled to maintain my interest throughout this very long, very sciency movie.It takes an age to get going for one thing, over-developing in my opinion, the relationships between widower Matthew McConaughey, his grounded, land-loving son and reach-for-the-sky genius daughter, at the same time, establishing his own credentials as a brilliant maverick space-pilot, setting us up for the meeting with old prof Michael Caine in another predictable feet-under-the-bed casting by Nolan and his eco-warrior daughter, played by Anne Hathaway, where he learns of the secret plan to reach out to other worlds for possible solutions to the dust-storm crisis on our earth which if unchecked will see the planet's extinction. And so McConnaughey, Hathaway and their small band of brothers hop on a big space rocket to seek out the three most promising of the twelve missions previously undertaken to this end but the only meaningful encounter they have is with Matt Damon's stranded scientist. After an Apollo 13-like miraculous return to Earth, McConaughey gets all discombobulated in the space time continuum as he tries to go back to the original moment he left his daughter to leave her a message to save all the future bother. This circular-time folding-back-on-itself skit has been done before more than once (I can even remember it in a Harry Potter film), thus reducing its effectiveness for me at the climax and whilst I can otherwise see Nolan projecting big issues like faith, forgiveness, guilt, hope, survival, family and of course love, I found the film to be slow-moving and clunky in construction.I wasn't engaged by the main characters and frankly got lost in all the science too while as regards the acting Caine and Damon are badly miscast in my opinion and as for the android which looks like a clothes peg and all that Dylan Thomas ""Do Not Go Gentle..."" guff - we all know it's a great poem anyway. Of course it may just be me remembering my thoughts on its two big-name antecedents but if people out there want to put this on a similar level to those they can be my guest. Not my type of film perhaps but then Nolan didn't do anything like enough here to change my preconceptions either.",Interstellar
50,ElMaruecan82,Is the Universe Friendly ?,9/10,21 August 2018,"According to Albert Einstein, that's the central question any human being should ask themselves in their lifetime; and if ""Friendly"" doesn't sound too science-friendly a term, let's remember that the iconic genius never took science as an end but a means to a humanistic end.Indeed, some secrets about our existence can be more profound and distant than any lone star from the furthest galaxy and perhaps the reason-to-be of science fiction is to leverage scientific speculation with an extra kick from human imagination, liberating a creative energy meant to anticipate the most daring solutions to our most troubling puzzlements... or simply put, to trust the future. Directed by Christopher Nolan (and co-written with his brother Jonathan), ""Interstellar"" isn't set at a time that leaves much for optimism: devastating blights are reducing the Earth resources to nil, dust storms make the air unbreathable and in this suffocating dystopia, even politics and crime became pointless. With a beaten spirit, humanity undergoes the slow apocalypse. But how can anyone be a pioneer or a conqueror again when any part of the world is doomed, when there's no 'West' to go anymore? What's left then is one single desperate measure we owe to a Science-fiction's classic : ""Keep watching the skies!"". One man follows the motto, a Midwest widower and previous ace pilot named ""Coop"" (Mathhew McConaughey). He doesn't know it yet but a scientist did the same, with fruitful results. Professor Brand (Michael Caine) found a ""path"" to a galaxy with potentially inhabitable planets. While it doesn't take the mind of Stephen Hawkins to understand that there would be no chance of survival in any planet of the Solar System, I wish the question of Mars could have been raised at least once.We also gather that the exodus wouldn't be just some fancy cruise and might last a bit longer than the one to the Promised Land, except if you precede years with ""light"", but this is where the interference (so to speak) between the screenplay originating from creative artists and a physicist named Dr. Kip Thorne introduced the fascinating concept of wormholes, sorts of tunnels that can take you from point A to another B within a universe comparable to a piece of paper fold in two, like a pencil cutting through it. And once you consider time as a fourth dimension, you guess the implications.Time travels, space travels, dystopian future, artificial intelligence ... is there one realistic sci-fi concept that ""Interstellar"" doesn't cover? Once again, Nolan proves that he's the star pupil of all filmmakers, and there's only one stardust of sarcasm in an inner space of admiration. I sincerely believe that the film is so ambitious in scale, CGI and practical effects and attention to scientific accuracy that it is beyond any rational criticism. Nolan's wish was a studio's command after the success of his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, if there ever is one to push the envelope, to be the 'Coop' of cinema, it's Nolan.
But there's one reason why ""Interstellar"" stands above other sci-fi blockbusters... no, not the romantic subplot with Anne Hathaway or Matt Damon's character. At the risk of sounding corny, many things are relative according to science, time is: one hour in a planet can equal 23 years, distance is no better as it can take as much time to jump from a galaxy to another as to travel from Santa Fe to Albuquerque. Still, there's one powerful force that hasn't unveiled all its mysteries and can be everything but relative, the power of attraction aka love power.There's this bonding between Coop and 'Murph' (Mackenzie Foe and Jessica Chastain for the adult version). Murph got her name from the infamous Murphy's law and the 'science-detective' virus and looks for any paranormal manifestation, some she calls ghosts... don't worry, there's an answer to everything and the rational answers provided later could only come from the man who designed the rubik-cube like plot of ""Inception"". Precise and effective, maybe a tad too effective. Nolan sure does this homework but sometimes, he gets so carried away by scientific perfectionism that he indulge to a few moments or lines where it's hard to keep a straight face.But even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" had such moments. In ""Interstellar"", I think I can sum up the criticism by saying that the film wanted to be many things instead of just one... and Nolan, wanted to make the consummate Sci-fi film, after which every sci-fi film director would ask himself ""what would Nolan do in that case?"". And I guess sometimes, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing realism for the sake of plausibility. Sometimes, I regret Nolan's perfectionism, could he make a movie like ""Back to the Future"" if no scientist could endorse the theory of the flux capacitor? Once again, paraphrasing his greatest character, I want to ask Nolan ""why so serious?"". ""Interstellar"" still touched me for its intelligence of the heart, the way it did answer Einstein question by making us parts of the universe, Earth can stop being friendly, not that divine whisper that made us exist can also figure out how to keep us ""immortal"" and it's all about entering a journey, not with rage, as Professor Brand repeats, but with the sheer conviction that there's got to be a way.Mathematics is the alphabet with which God created the Universe, so all it takes is to break the code through the powerful bonding between two people. Bogart said: ""it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". Well, according to ""Interstellar"", the problems of two little people matter a lot in the whole universe, in the great cosmic scheme of things.That's why, for all its visual effects, its Hans Zimmer's score and heart-pounding action sequences, the most memorable part of the film is McConaughey's bursting into tears after seeing his grown-up daughter.",Interstellar
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An space-epic sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.,10/10,12 May 2018,"'Interstellar (2014)' is a space-epic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. The mixture of earthy textures and sleek sci-fi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. While its third act does get a little existential and abstract, the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10

52,richardchatten,Through the Wormhole,7/10,24 January 2020,"Yet another expedition sets off to find a new home for the human race; a sci-fi staple since at least 'When Worlds Collide' nearly sixty years ago.Doomsday in the movies has regularly been postponed over the years ('Lost in Space', for example, was set in 1997) and is this time further delayed until the mid-21st century when depletion of the means to feed ourselves (""the world needs farmers"") provides the ticking clock.Since most of the film remains indoors (thank God! Since the camera usually wobbles maddeningly during most of the exterior scenes) the film remains pristine looking in the best tradition of sci-fi filmmaking (especially Anne Hathaway in a spacesuit). But it's nearly three hours long and somebody really should have told the cast - especially Matthew McConaughey - to stop mumbling, speak up and talk faster.And as usual any pretence at sustaining a narrative is ultimately discarded in favour of a welter of special effects.",Interstellar
53,ThomasDrufke,Go Further,10/10,9 November 2014,"Sometimes a film can be grand and epic in scale compared to others in one or a few categories. Interstellar manages to just about be the boldest in every single category of the filmmaking process. Christopher Nolan makes his most ambitious film yet and one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. You can tell he was influenced by many of the great Sci-Fi classics including 2001: A Space Odyssey. But I think you can also seem glimpses of Sunshine, The Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and even Close Encounters of the Third Kind.It was my number 1 most anticipated film this year and it lived up to the hype. Of course it wasn't at all what I really expected considering Nolan hid so much from us, which is amazing for the year we live in. You know when you sit down at a Nolan film you will be both entertained and educated.The film itself is very complex and has a lot going on. I waited until I had seen the movie 3 times before even writing this review. After my first watch I didn't really know what to do with myself. I walked out of the Navy Pier IMAX 70mm film theater and was just in awe of what I just saw. I appreciate how much thought Nolan puts into his projects and the fact that he expects us to actually pay attention and it's not just some mindless blockbuster. I have now seen this film 3 times in 24 hours and I'm still not completely sure I understand everything Nolan was going for. To me the film is about hope. It's an optimistic view on the world and how we need to go back to our roots and go further than what we think we have settled for. I like his use of baseball in the film as a parallel for our pastime. Baseball is America's pastime and our roots. Perhaps it was on purpose perhaps not.The performances are phenomenal. Led by Matthew McConaughey, who gives a gut wrenching performance. I won't go through how great everyone was, but Jessica Chastain also stood out. I think she has a shot at a best supporting actress nod, whereas McConaughey is in a much more packed group. The father daughter relationship was beautiful and definitely fulfilling. It takes a bit of time to finally go on the mission but once they do, it never slows down. The cinematography was gorgeous, especially while going through the wormholes. Seeing it IMAX was stunning and proved Nolan doesn't necessarily need Wally Pfister to give us great looking films. Compliment that with Hans Zimmer's beautiful score and you already have yourself a thrilling experience. I love that Zimmer didn't push ""Braaaam"" type score like he has been accused of overusing at times. The main theme is just beautiful and perfectly accommodates the film.There a few subtle moments that really got to me. One being when they realize they have been on the planet for 23 years and come back to find Romilly old and gray. The other being the chilling video message scenes. I can't praise McConaughey enough for how well those scenes were acted. I had a lot of trouble holding back the tears. It was just heartbreaking knowing how long his kids were waiting for him. Sure the decision to leave them is selfish but what would you do? If you're truly believing you're saving human kind wouldn't you at least exercise that option? The different worlds they visited were stunning and gave us some of the most intense scenes in the film. Matt Damon's ""cameo"" was interesting and definitely longer than I thought. I knew he was in the film, but had no idea to what extent or who he was playing.The moment we realize Coop is trapped in the fifth dimension and he was the ""ghost behind the bookshelves"" was heartbreaking. It was one of the many brilliantly acted scenes by McConaughey, and one that many people were quietly saying ""oh my god"" to in the theater every time I went. To fully understand all the science and complications they have to go through on this journey was difficult. But I don't think that's the point. The point is optimism. That if we reach higher, break barriers, and go further perhaps we can save our world if we ever get to that point. I will say I wish they would have given us a broader view of our dying world so we feel like this mission really is our last chance. I also think the way they handled Coop leaving Murph in the final scene was underwhelming for how much it was built up, but these are minor complaints. I still can't wait to see what Nolan does next.It's one of the most amazing experiences I have had with a film, even though I don't even think it's one of Nolan's best. It was Nolan's grandest and by far most emotion and personal film. It had many of his signature moments but also had much more hope than all of his other films have. This film isn't perfect by any means but it has everybody talking. Isn't that what film is all about? I don't think giving it a 10 means it has no problems whatsoever, but I think it means it's a film that will stand the test of time and quite possibly is actually important to people and this world. Hopefully this film will inspire other filmmakers to go the extra mile.+McConaughey's heartbreaking performance +Chastain & Foy's Murph +Video message scenes +True cinematic IMAX experience +Most ambitious film I've ever seen +Depiction of other worlds/wormholes +Hans Zimmer's beautiful score +Influenced by many Sci-Fi classics +Entire cast & cameo performances +Optimistic -Final goodbye 10/10",Interstellar
54,cricketbat,Not my favorite Christopher Nolan film,6/10,11 October 2018,"Interstellar is a well-crafted, deep-thinking film full of amazing visuals and a story that sparks conversation with others, but it's not my favorite Christopher Nolan film. Even though the odd pacing may have been intentional, it made the film seem sloppy to me. There were some parts that they sped through, whereas other scenes seemed to drag on for decades. Objectively, I can appreciate what this film has to offer, but it's not one that I'd choose to own and watch repeatedly.

55,lesleyharris30,"A True Masterpiece of Modern Day Film,",10/10,14 November 2014,"Interstellar is an outstanding movie with a really well developed storyline and a superb cast. Christopher Nolan returns with his first movie since he finished the Batman trilogy and proves once again how original and intelligent he really is as both a writer and director, he is without a doubt one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood at the moment. It looks absolutely beautiful, probably one of the most realistic space movies to date in terms of effects, I would even say it looks better than Gravity. The sound is overwhelming, I was completely engrossed by all the intense scenes and the very engaging story, I forget who I was and everything around me, that's what I really love about movies, which does not happen as rarely as it should, that you forget you are watching a movie. The cast is, of course, outstanding, Matthew McConaughey delivers another stellar performance that he will surely get an Academy Award nomination for, as well as Anne Hathaway, John Lithgow, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine and several other great actors that I don't want to spoil because they do not come around until later on and are a really pleasant surprise that adds to the fun and excitement. Dramatic, sweet, emotional, intense and simply outstanding, Interstellar is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2014 and I would highly recommend it to all moviegoers. It had me completely swept away. A group of astronauts are sent on a mission to save their planet, but the few weeks that they spend it space will take away years of life back on Earth. Best Performance: Matthew McConaughey",Interstellar
56,secondtake,Ambitions make the filming amazing and the plot illogical to sentimental absurdity,7/10,13 November 2014,"Interstallar (2014)This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like ""Memento"" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call ""meaning."" They are entertainments. ""Interstellar"" is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something ""deep"" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in ""Batman Rises"" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But ""Interstallar"" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see ""Gravity"" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.) Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.",Interstellar
57,A_Different_Drummer,"Combining ENTER THE VOID, THE LAST MIMSEY and .. GENESIS",10/10,23 January 2015,"Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood.With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours.This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content.How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears.The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title.This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda.I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on.BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going ""super,"" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.) The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool.Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. Which is itself a strange contradiction.But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended.So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time.Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough.As I keep saying, a very strange movie.But a very powerful one*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016****Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I ""got"" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.",Interstellar

We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us."" Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough.

60,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,9/10,16 March 2015,"InterstellarThe hardest part of finding a habitable planet is finding one that hasn't already been ravaged by humans.Fortunately, the astronauts in this sci-fi film are hominids so they know where not to look.NASA approaches former employee Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to pilot a spacecraft carrying scientists (Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley) and robots that will enter a wormhole to recover lost data that could lead to a new home world. Meanwhile on the expiring Earth, Coop's grown children (Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck) struggle with the realization their father isn't returning for them.From the remarkable mind of co-writer/director Christopher Nolan, Interstellar is a stunning space epic that perfectly balances heart-pounding action and cerebral stimulation.A love story as much as a survival story, Interstellar travels light-years to find humanity.However, telling your kids you're going out for cigarettes is a less complicated way of ditching them than some wormhole excuse.

61,Bored_Dragon,"""Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.""",7/10,6 October 2021,"With his filmography, and especially the Batman trilogy and the film ""Inception"", Nolan earned the reputation of one of the greatest directors of today, as well as complete freedom in shooting his next projects. I fully understand the trust placed in him by the studio, but, unlike most, I don't think he really justified it.""Interstellar"" is considered one of the best SF films of all time, and many perceive it as one of the best movies overall. From my perspective, it's not even Nolan's best. ""Dunkirk"", ""Inception"", all three Batmans, ""The Prestige"", ... all of his movies I've seen so far are at least a class better than this.Its aesthetics and atmosphere reminded me a lot of Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", but even with half a century more modern technology, it is not nearly as fascinating and impressive. While ""Odyssey"" is mostly breathtaking, even regardless of the time of its creation, ""Interstellar"" is visually beautiful, at times even fascinating to the eye, but it did not touch me emotionally, nor did I have that gooseflesh feel along the spine that does not let you sit still while watching Kubrick's masterpiece.Speaking of the comparison with ""Odyssey"", I noticed that many complain about the excessive duration of Nolan's film. No, the problem doesn't lie in the three hours duration, or even in the pace at which the story unfolds. ""Odyssey"" is also a long film and at a much slower pace than ""Interstellar"", but it has a mesmerizing atmosphere that nails you to the screen, which ""Interstellar"" unfortunately does not have.While I'm still at the visual aspect of the film, I must also mention the great opportunity that this film missed. Visits to the planets in another galaxy were the perfect moment to let your imagination run wild and to engrave this movie in the memory of viewers with striking scenes of distant worlds. Instead, we've got two completely uninspiring and unoriginal scenes of the spacecraft's immediate surroundings, so there's no exploration of the new worlds and enjoying never-before-seen scenery. I don't even know why they used CGI, they could easily shot those scenes somewhere in the Arctic and get the same effect.As for the scientific aspect of the story, I understand physics and astronomy so poorly that I am not in the least competent to judge how much the film respects known physical laws, let alone those that go into theoretical assumptions. Still, as the film progressed, this aspect too seemed more and more unconvincing, until the very end and the scene in the multiverse of the daughter's room, which, at least for me, drove the last nail into the coffin of the scientific foundation of this film.The very end of the film is the biggest minus to me, because I think that the ""happy"" end (if it can be called happy at all ...) is inappropriate and breaks the atmosphere that the film had built until then. In addition, it remained unexplained how such an end came about and how it is possible at all, which is also the biggest hole in this story.The dramatic aspect is something I can discuss and it is one of the strengths of this film, although the characters were not particularly convincing to me, and many of their actions seemed unnatural. As if they are not in line with the characters, but there only to push the story in the desired direction.The only truly convincing character, perfectly written and acted, a character who shows the true human nature of an individual faced with the dilemma between self-preservation and the well-being of humanity, is a character masterfully played by Matt Damon. Some of us will find ourselves in his fear and submission to completely natural human instincts, others will strongly condemn him (many of them very hypocritically), but it is indisputable that he stands out among the other characters in this film as Jordan in ""Space Jam"".If you want an atmosphere of space that freezes the blood in your veins or unsurpassed metaphysical depth, you can always go back to ""Odyssey"", for space action there is ""Star Wars"", and there are plenty of post-apocalyptic dramas with a stronger emotion. To be clear, ""Interstellar"" is far from being a bad film, it's an above-average pastime to watch, but I think its reputation and cult status are more a consequence of the name Christopher Nolan than the quality of the film itself.7/10.",Interstellar
62,851222,"""Interstellar"" is everything you can expect from a motion picture and beyond",10/10,9 November 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Interstellar"" to simply put, is a magnificent motion picture. It is a close call masterpiece (surely a classic). The whole hype wasn't just a hype, it's true, and you have to witness it on the big screen to truly appreciate it. It has everything a true sci- fi movie should have and everything that a truly great motion picture must have. Everything here works on the highest level. The music (without doubts, a locked Oscar nomination), sound / sound effects (two possible Oscar winners), acting, directing, script special effects (a sure nominee) are a top notch, and combined with realistic sci-fi ideas, this movie is must see. It has to go down as one of (if not THE) very best science fiction movies off all times.Overall, ""Interstellar"" is as good as movies goes. It has everything to held you glued to the screen for almost 3 hours, but trust me, watching ""Interstellar"" you will be delivered to a movie magic without a wormhole help.

Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's ""2001"" or the atmospherics of ""Blade Runner"" or the thrilling ride of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

64,westsideschl,A Dumbing Down Experience,3/10,20 April 2015,"A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love.",Interstellar
65,tabuno,The Breakthrough Sci Fi Movie of the Decade,10/10,15 January 2019,"8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating ""long-distance"" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet. Even Ann Hathaway's under-stated surprisingly diminutive performance stands out as a directorial and acting highlight considering Hathaway's bigger than life screen presence and public popularity of the past that enhancing the impact of the movie.The overall direction and performances in this movie are introspective and authentic in their approach much like that found in the sci fi drama Stranded (2001) or Apollo 18 (2011) that don't rely on big screen stereotypical theatrics to wow its audiences. Somehow this supposedly epic sci fi adventure is as intimate as Cloud Atlas (2012) was as large spanning literally hundreds of years. Unlike a number of other review references comparing Interstellar to the visual style of sci fi action thriller Inception (2010) or some brief resemblance to Gravity (2013), Interstellar seems to take more from the sci fi relational drama Upside Down (2013) and the sci fi space drama Elysium (2013). As for plot outline, one can argue that Interstellar has more in common with the sci fi mystery of Oblivion (2013) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968 ) especially with noted theoretical leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific consultant and executive producer. And in contrast, the minimalist music score is in departure to A Space Odyssey's dominating and sometimes haunting musical score. This mind twisting experience includes pieces of the emotion and twisting, off balance characteristics of Déjà vu (2006).Some might complain about the extended dialogue, there really is a more satisfying exchange of relevant thoughtful ideas during this movie that are interspersed among amazing special effects that are leading edge for our literal time and space. When it comes to cerebral and emotive impact, Interstellar does so in a more narrative, mystery drama fashion as Ender's Game (2013) hit the similar points using a war action, adventure motif. The sci fi television mini-series The Triangle (2005) brought many of the intriguing and suspense aspects in a lower budgeted, popular mass audience approach, but also indicating how Interstellar was presented in a quality, big budget, high definition big screen format with a corresponding mesmerizing impact. What makes Interstellar so markedly ground breaking is director's Christopher Nolan's leap with this movie in its freshness and significantly different visual presentation, its tight editing and retention of the human relational importance while also presenting to dual track story outline in seamless and meaningful power way. Interstellar recalls the similar breathing mind-bending experiences in Brainstorm (1983) with Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken. Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster and also co-starring Matthew McConaughey, the children's version of A Wrinkle In Time (2002), the otherworldly time altering classic of Slaughter-House Five (1972), the haunting alien ambiance of Solaris (2002).",Interstellar
66,ironhorse_iv,Interstellar was indeed pretty stellar.,8/10,17 November 2014,"Interstellar will divide the audience. Some of them will love and enjoy this movie, while others will see it as a boring film and feel the long 3 movie pace. Interstellar is no way, a popcorn fun film. It's a smart man film. It's remind me, so much of 1968's 2001: A Space Odessey, both in visuals and how people reaction to it. Both films, receive mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. I think like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie, Interstellar will garnered a cult following and slowly became a bigger box office hit, but right now, it's up in the air. While, the movie seem to taking a lot of homage to that film, Interstellar seem grounded by the director own identification. It's a film that couldn't blast away, even if a lot of determination went into making this film. The reason is, because people have become so aware of what Director & Writer Christopher Nolan will do. Without spoiling it, too much, the movie has a lot of overused Nolanism tropes & clichés. This means a lot of exposition dialogue with characters explain through dialogue their innermost feelings, instead of, acting those emotions out. Add the elaborate, flashback-heavy narrative structure, and lots of science mucho jumbo, and you get a film that will confused people. Some people think, it is a fallacy, but in my opinion, it's not inherently bad. They're alright in the right doses. People need to be challenge in films. People need to think. If you're so caught up on Nolanisms, you'll never let yourself enjoy the film, as a whole. I think some people just didn't get it. I don't blame them, I love the film, but parts of the film are indeed slow pace, and hard to understand. Even with a love for Quantum physics, space travel and psychology before this film, I had a hard time following what's going on. Like 2001 Space Odyssey, this movie lacks the broad appeal to an audience whom unaware for a need of such deep intelligent research. Maybe, it was a bit overreaching in its direction; as the film feels less a film, a more of a science lecture. You really have to tune in; to get, most of it. The trailers were no help, coming in. The film is about a team of astronauts whom travel through a wormhole in an attempt to find a potentially habitable planet that will sustain humanity, because Earth cannot longer manage life. I found a lot of things jarring in the film, like example, how they use a Saturn like rocket to escape out of Earth's astrosphere, but later on the film, they're able to leave, most planet's upper astrosphere with ease with their little spacecraft. A major error that I have spotted is the matter of the planets where gravitational forces cause such extreme time dilation that an hour on that planet equals seven years for us on Earth. Technically, yes, it's a possible, but the gravitational forces necessary to bring this about, would be so extreme that no planet, let alone people, would survive such gravity pull. Why couldn't they go to Saturn's moons? After all, scientists have pointed out that Saturn's moon Titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life. Save you the time, and effect. I know, everyone on Earth has infinite resources, despite large blight dust-clouds, but come on! The movie felt like two movies, mixed together. I think the first half of the film movie is very Sci-fiction, with the second half of the film after the wormhole, a bit Sci-fantasy, because how much, it lacks true science. Even if we can make a wormhole, the equations show that they're unstable and they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So, that's where the science fiction comes in. Kip Thorne put an amazing amount of research into the film, but the film does have some moments that you might have to suspend your disbelief in. I'm glad, the second half is that way, because it got really boring in the first half of the film. Way too much talking into the first part of the film. Most of the action and tense moments, play out in the second part. One of the biggest fears in the film is Einstein's special theory of relativity. I think the problem of relativity, played very well in the film as characters are afraid of wasting time. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer is a great role for him. I love the tense relationship with him, and his daughter, Murph played by Mackenzie Foy (Age 11) & Jessica Chastain (Age 37). You really see the pain that Cooper goes through, when he sees his children, growing up fast in front of him. While the ending is very clunky, it was very emotionally and physically draining to watch. Indeed, Matthew could act. He was the anchor that kept the story, grounded. Still, it was bit a stretch, at times, hard to believe, that his character spend most of his later life, farming, but still able to be an accurate ace pilot who can play a spacecraft through black holes, and dock on spinning out of control space station. Jessica Chastain is great in the secondary role. Anne Hathaway, while overacting in her role as Brand, Coop's co-explorer; was mostly alright, despite her character, doing a lot of stupid selfish things. The rest of the supporting cast were pretty good with their parts. I do love the smart ass robots. I thought the visuals were amazing. Must watch on IMAX. I thought the music by Han Zimmer was absolutely beautiful and really made the dramatic scenes including the end scene with the twist all the more engaging. Still, it was overbearing, and the sound mixer were pretty bad as I couldn't hear the dialogue, when the music is playing. Overall: Despite its faults, it's a good movie.",Interstellar
67,nairtejas,A Dazzling Spectacle About Space Voyages. ♦ 70%,7/10,11 November 2014,"While I was calm as space until I found the propaganda take effect on the plot, I couldn't really decipher why flashy humor and melodrama (read sentiments) was in abundance about a journey which requires serious concentration. Of course, the makers, the film lovers, and people who pretend to be in the crowd by advertising they are the film lovers - they all could bring up many reasons about it: ""humankind is involved, bud. what do you think humans are? we are emotional, you ignorant piece of space debris!"" Others may say: ""humor lets them relax, don't you see? Man, Nolan is God. Nolan Nolan Nolan!""Agreed.I'm just an opinion-er. The plot starting off depending more on Hans Zimmer than the actual visuals, Interstellar talks about a near- future Earth (non-fiction #1) where crops are dying, dust storms are giving people not rashes, but serious, cancerous lung diseases, and people are forced into agriculture (Orwellian? or simply fascist?). So, the people who are actually farmers but pretend to be geniuses with lots of love for their daughters and sons and baseball, stick drapes to their shoulders and play faulty superheroes. Matthew McConaughey is one such character. He is very good, and I would have used the word ""excellent"" had it been a weepy melodrama with Meryl Streep as the actress who talks about saving the Earth by committing suicide or something, eventually both sweeping the Oscars. But, no, you have more annoying characters to come.The superheroes, commissioned by a propagandist Sir Michael Caine through NASA, go on a voyage to find a habitat for humans who are all dying by coughing only or maybe starving, too. Now I was thoroughly impressed by the space spectacle (fiction #1). Double Negative folks are really something; Inception, even. While it will remind you of Gravity, it holds it for too long and this is where melodrama kicks in. Mind you, as we go further, you will find humor in the nooks and corners of the film. You may laugh, you may weep, and all science fiction disappears in thin air, unless you think the inside of a space shuttle in a studio shown in the film gives you the wind of it. Altercations between the characters kicks in, and it seemed they didn't only annoy the audience, but each other, too. Anne Hathaway was annoying, although her character seemed real (non- fiction #2). Expendables 4 is what you will see for the next few minutes. I am starting to recoil from Nolan's notions just because of one particular scene, which takes up almost all of the second half and all we see is the constipated characters doing a interstellar space stunt with a shuttle and their roving vehicle. After the scene, there is heavy humor and the characters testify it. Irony.The time and space parameters with respect to their linearity and how age matters was wonderful to watch and it was the only new thing that fascinated me in this celluloid. The next interesting stuff were the climax sequences, which you will require at least some basic idea about physics in order to construe. It was like Upstream Colour, but with more CGI and brains.There is intergalactic fight scene between two astronauts which may not have been put up for humor effect, but I laughed. A villain (non-fiction #3) comes out of nowhere and takes up at least 20 minutes, which further upset me.The main story as a whole is, thus a mixture of fiction and non- fiction. The science about dimensions was really food for thought and mesmerizing to watch. To ponder upon the final sequences per se will bring you pleasure and you may end up clapping, even, but that is how Nolan's films have been all these years. They flip-flop from one element to another, sometimes without coercing them together. This leads to a pressurized air gap in any normal moviegoer's analysis. I think I may have helped in breaking the pressure.A film which 1. refreshes propagandist theories about government and survival and holds onto it (which people are somehow trying to forget and move on with their lives and click selfies), and 2. uses thematic elements unfathomable to normal audience cannot be considered a masterpiece, at least in celluloid. Dante's Divine Comedy is understandable, so is Rodin's The Thinker. And so was Nolan's Inception. But, Nolan's Interstellar, which is an artistic space film, but fails in many other sub-genres? You decide.BOTTOM LINE: Interstellar is a dazzling spectacle and I use the word ""spectacle"" because it mocks itself in some ways, publishing a story so naive and situational and dramatic, it is a modified version of what ended up in Kubrick's or even Ridley Scott's work-desk garbage bin 20 years ago.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",Interstellar
68,The-Sarkologist,Christopher Nolan does it Again,9/10,8 November 2014,"Interstellar: 2014 (Christopher Nolan) – 9 I really don't want to repeat what others have already said about this masterpiece of film making except that I absolutely agree with them. Nolan has certainly exceeded his expectations as a film maker and has created a film that will go down as a work of art. This is not surprising since many of us have already seen his Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception, however Interstellar seems to have taken him to a new level.Matthew McCoCounaughey has never really been an actor that has caught my attention, and prior to seeing this film I was a little sceptical with him playing the lead role, however within the first fifteen minutes my doubts were simply blown away. The way he takes the character of Cooper, especially the struggle between him wanting to be an engineer (and wanting his children to follow in his footsteps), and the necessity of him being a farmer really created depth to his character, and the way he stood out from the other big name actors such as John Lithgow, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon has clearly demonstrated that he certainly has matured in his acting ability.The one thing about the film making that really stood out (and if you have read many of my previous reviews you will know that I generally do not focus of the nuts and bolts of the film, but rather the themes and ideas that come out of the film) is the brilliant use of the soundtrack. The sound, and the music, were merged so well into the film that it literally became a living work of art. Nolan has certainly taken the idea of the film out of the the realm of base entertainment and into the world of art.It is interesting that I have recently finished reading Hawking's book 'A brief History of Time' because, even though Hawkings is never mentioned in the film, having a much better understanding of modern physics helped me see aspects of the story much better than I would have if I had not read it. For instance, Hawkings talks about unified physics though we have yet to reconcile gravitational force with the other forces in the universe. However it is interesting to note (and this comes out in Einstein) how gravity and time appear to be related. This is something that regularly comes out in Interstellar, that is the relationship between time and gravity. This is clearly seen with regards to the black hole, where the closer you get to the gravitational distortion, the slower time goes relative to yourself. Where they only spend an hour on 'Miller's Planet', twenty three years have passed on Earth, to the point that it is believed that the mission has become a failure. This relationship becomes even more relevant near the end of the movie. The other thing that I note in regards to this relation is that gravity is the only force that does not have an equal and opposite force – all gravity does is attract, it does not repel in the same way that the other forces do. So is the case with time – it only ever goes forward – it does not stop, nor does it go backward, and it is the subtlety of these two aspects of our universe that Nolan uses to great advantage.Another aspect that I noticed in the film is what is termed the tyranny of distance. In our modern world this tyranny has since been defeated. We can travel around the world in less that two days (flying commercially that is), and we can communicate with people almost instantaneously. However, Nolan brings this tyranny back to confront us in force in Interstellar. The scene is initially set that the Earth as a habitable planet is on its last legs, however the solution to the problem is not a quick solution. Even to get to the wormhole to take them to the other galaxy where there is a possibility of a habitable planet (and the characters never know through the entire movie whether the planet exists or not) takes them two years, and once they are through the wormhole while they can receive messages from Earth, they cannot respond, or if they can, their response is very limited. Once again time also comes into play because time is forever marching forward, for both the Earth and the explorers, and the tyranny makes the possibility of the mission being a success ever more unlikely.Unfortunately I am quickly coming to the end of the word count required for my commentary, and I still have not yet touched upon other themes that come out in the film, such as loneliness (space travel, as indicated in other films, is very lonely) and also some of the ideas of the black hole (where the laws of physics end up breaking down completely), however these are some things that the film also causes us to think about, and I am sure I have only scratched the surface.",Interstellar
69,Reno-Rangan,"True to the science and a few fictions, artistic yet entertains.",9/10,12 November 2014,"Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers.As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.It was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.''This world's a treasure, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.''All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the screen space in the story presentation. The fine performances from Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was also great and was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science- fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film.''Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory.''The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",Interstellar
70,briancham1994,"Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.",5/10,25 May 2020,"MY BACKGROUND:
Considering all the intense feelings around Christopher Nolan that often rear their enraged heads through online amateur reviews, I must profess where I stand from the outset. I am neither a ""fanboy"" nor a ""hater"" of the Nolan brand. I prefer his work up to and including The Prestige, but not much of his work afterwards, so any overall attachment balances out. I don't feel as if I have something to prove when watching or discussing his films.That said, I am a science fiction fan (""fan"" with a lowercase ""f"" if you know what I mean; don't expect me at the next Comic-Con) so I thought this might make for interesting viewing. Lately I did some layman reading on cosmology for an unrelated project, so either I knew enough to grasp the scientific concepts in the film or I was delusional enough to believe so.THOUGHTS:
Not impressed.We start off with a dry, dusty, dismal, dying future where the protagonist (played by a perpetually bored Matthew McConaughey) struggles to keep up harvests on his family farm. We are shown (i.e. beaten on the head by) suggestions that a ""ghost"" is pushing books off his daughter's bookshelf. At that point I hoped that the climax would not involve the typical sci-fi transcendence of space and time, with the protagonist becoming this ""ghost"" and using his new-found cosmic powers to push some books around. But more on this later.From that point the film reveals two of its biggest flaws - bad pacing and bad characters. The family spends a long time going through exposition, bonding, baseball, education issues and hacking an Indian drone but never build much of a substantial relationship in the viewer's mind. It just serves to repeatedly hammer in the superficial point that the protagonist is an all-American family man who loves his daughter, but not much else.After a very long time we finally get to something related to space and the premise when the protagonist stumbles upon a top secret NASA base. The scientists all unquestioningly conclude that his finding of the base must constitute advice from magical gravity beings (what a scientific deduction) and hire him as a space pilot for a world-saving mission almost on-the-spot. Yet even after launch, the film still drags on to a degree I haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. What follows is more plodding filler scenes in orbit, near Saturn, in a lab and so on. Due to the effects of relativity, each hour passing on a watery planet they encounter is the same as seven years passing on Earth; due to the effects of slow pacing, each hour watching this movie certainly felt like seven years too. And this is coming from someone who could tolerate the pacing of Solaris!At some point on the water planet a crew member dies, but I don't remember his name, appearance or role since they were all interchangeable humans. At no point did I care about these bland, personality-deprived non-characters. This extended to the maudlin moments where the protagonist would mope over his daughter or vice versa, which just felt like shoehorned emotion without any real heart or connection. Instead of experiencing the stakes of aging, absence or the fate of the human species, I just wished for the plot to get somewhere.The gravity of the mission never really weighs in on the audience (excuse the puns) as the characters always find ways to subsume it with their personal concerns. The protagonist never shuts up about his family and never fails to base his mission decisions on their fate only. Okay, we get it, you care about your family. Can we move on now? The primary plan of Anne Hathaway's character turns out to be chasing THE POWER OF LOVE™. A stranded scientist played by Matt Damon jeopardises the mission and attempts to murder the protagonist to find a way off the planet. This may be intentional but it's hard to hold any hope for humanity when these expeditions seem to be staffed by the least professional personnel available.Near the end, the protagonist decides that he must hurl himself and a robot into the nearest black hole and send the recorded data back to Earth. He is convinced that this will work even though they establish that nothing can escape a black hole and their craft has had no success in communicating back. If the plan succeeds, the protagonist's daughter can save humanity by using the data to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Apparently Loop Quantum Gravity doesn't already do that (did the science advisor believe LQG to be less plausible than five-dimensional bulk gravity ghosts?). Besides, if one end of a wormhole is a black hole, shouldn't they have this data already?So he executes this plan and we get the non-twist that he becomes the ""ghost"" from the beginning of the film, which should surprise nobody. Well, who else would it be? The daughter herself? (which was my backup prediction). Using THE POWER OF LOVE™ which transcends space and time (groan), he sends the data back to his daughter and she saves humanity. There's an epilogue with a cheap reunion but it just fills up time.Lest anyone think that I hate this film through and through, it does have its good moments. Even if the opening scenes dragged on for too long, they worked well to establish a dreary world where human civilisation is stagnating painfully rather than the usual sci-fi apocalypse which happens in an instant. The CGI sequences of the wormhole travel and tesseract were gorgeous and unique with interesting visual concepts like light distortion and higher dimensions. Unlike many others I found the soundtrack to be rousing and powerful rather than needlessly bombastic. It's a shame that none of it accompanied scenes with emotion of equal intensity.WHAT WOULD I DO?
Hypothetically, if I could change anything about Interstellar, what would it be?As I'm sure anyone can infer by now, my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. There is not enough content to last for 169 minutes; cutting down to a typical runtime of 90-120 minutes would suffice. The beginning spent too long lingering on Earth introducing the setting and characters without setting up the premise. I would have majorly restructured the film so it immediately starts out in space (like Sunshine) and builds up the characters and backstory through regular, well-timed flashbacks (like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours or LOST). These would cover all of the crew members, not just the protagonist, who would have their own distinct personalities, motivations, roles and backgrounds (more than just ""I miss my father"" and ""I am a family man""). This would give context to their behaviour and interactions in the ""present"". We should care more about these characters, who they are and whether they succeed.At the start of the third act, the cutaways would stop going to the past and start showing the time period when the children have grown up. Until this point the messages from Earth don't get through, so we don't get pointless teary moments until the relationships have been properly built up for the audience.The missions should be more coherent and less improvised. There is a proper briefing. Nobody is hired on-the-spot. The previous exploration through the wormhole used orbital and aerial robots like in Alien Planet. Who is trying to find what, where, and report it back to whom, before what deadline? Stick to one thing. Cut out the time-wasting scenario with Matt Damon's scientist.The general concept behind the tesseract climax is fine, though it is executed as a predictable deus ex machina. Don't bring in ghosts, gravity messages and trans-dimensional wormhole benefactors at the beginning. That sort of mystery is on-the-nose and the audience expects it to be explained eventually, negating any potential surprise. A good plot twist should be completely unexpected. I would make any climactic time travel explain events that the audience never realised needed an explanation, but make sense in hindsight.The time travelling actions should be more interesting than pushing books and sending data. Maybe the protagonist interacts directly with the future, or interacts with the past of a hitherto unrelated character, or something of the sort. Maybe the actions of the protagonist directly lead to human civilisation transcending space-time, so the tesseract construction concept doesn't just come out of nowhere. It also needs to feel justified thematically. The rest of the film had a strong emphasis on physics concepts and mentioned relativity a lot, which jars with the sudden revelation of infinite cosmic bookshelves inside a survivable black hole. Starting with the same fantasy tone would make the film consistent and make the climax more palatable.The epilogue is unnecessary. The protagonist already reunited with his daughter through all the time travel ghost stuff, which was cathartic enough. His actions have more meaning if they culminate in an ultimate sacrifice, so he should die in the black hole's singularity.Some other minor changes I would have made:Show alien landscapes that actually look alien, not just the ocean and Iceland.Cut out the Disney-esque, New Age, hippie nonsense about THE POWER OF LOVE™.Stop repeating that poem so many damn times.Make the robot less annoying.FINAL VERDICT:
Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.4.5/10",Interstellar
71,tomgillespie2002,You have to admire the ambition,8/10,31 March 2015,"Christopher Nolan and his writing partner/brother Jonathan have made a career out of delivering cold, intelligent blockbusters that often work like a puzzle-box slowly unravelling in front of your face. For their next trick, the duo have tackled the great beyond, gazing in awe at the skies while ensuring the heavy layer of science makes sense. You may need a degree or a PhD to fully understand what is going on here, but the Nolan's respect their audience enough to allow their exposition-heavy story to unfold without spoon-feeding. Interstellar is their most ambitious, while not their best, project yet.In the near-future, Earth is slowly succumbing to famine due to crop blight. History is being re-written in schools to drive home the importance of saving the planet, and ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is one of many given the responsibility of growing a successful crop. When a mysterious force sends binary messages to him through a bookcase in the bedroom of his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), Cooper arrives at a secret NASA base, where Professor John Brand (Michael Caine) is planning to send a willing crew of astronauts through a wormhole in space to search for a new home for humanity. Their previous mission has uncovered three potential planets, but the astronauts have not been heard from since.Cooper, leaving his devastated young daughter behind, and a small crew (consisting of Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi and a humorous robot) set off on the mission, while Brand stays on Earth to work out the formula that will solve the problem of transporting every man, woman and child on Earth millions of light years through space. One of the planets is so close to a black hole that it causes gravitational time dilation, meaning that every hour spent on its surface is seven years of time back home. After a disastrous mission, Coop finds that his children have aged 23 years (and becoming Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck in the process), and Murph is now working for Professor Brand.While this is a lot of plot to take in, and it really isn't the half of it, the Nolans' skill at storytelling and narrative mean that you feel that, no matter how insane the proceedings get, things are going to add up in the end. When the film often threatens to get muddled with heavy explanatory dialogue that doesn't really help and trying to help us understand the workings of black holes, gravity and space travel, Nolan ensures that he doesn't lose his focus. The big idea is that we are not meant to stay here. We are destined to leave, explore and discover. Nolan's passion for the subject is clear as day, and his sense of wonder is brought to life by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, who paints space as something wonderful, strange, and f*****g terrifying.Despite the film's often crazy ideas, it feels authentic. Nolan worked closely with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne on developing the film, so Interstellar is (ironically) grounded, and Nolan wisely doesn't try to replicate the philosophical approach of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). It's far from perfect - you could easily pick at plot-(black)holes, some explanatory scenes are heavy-handed and ridiculous, and the warm-up is far too long - but you have to admire the ambition, and be grateful that there's a film-maker out there who can repeatedly prove that the casual movie-goer isn't stupid. 2001's crown is comfortably safe, but Interstellar is a fascinating, engaging and one-of-a-kind experience. Even if you don't like it, I bet you'll be talking about it for days afterwards. Plus it has the most lovable astronaut's-best-friend robots since Silent Running (1972).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Interstellar
72,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing movie...,9/10,21 March 2015,"""Interstellar"" is a Sci - Fi movie in which we watch a group of explorers who travel through a wormhole in order to save humanity from extinction. Humanity is in danger because earth has been devastated by drought and famine, and humans can not farm and produce anything on it. So the group of the explorers wants to find a new planet for humanity.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was simply magnificent and the direction which made by Christopher Nolan was equally good. The best thing which I liked from the plot was the theory of relativity and how this can influence people. I also believe that this movie is one of the few in which we can see and observe the actual results of this theory. I liked the interpretation of Anne Hathaway who played as Brand and she was very good at it. But I believe that the best interpretation in this movie belongs to Matthew McConaughey who played as Cooper and he was simply outstanding. Another good interpretation that I have to mention is Michael Caine's who played as Professor Brand.Finally I have to say that ""Interstellar"" is a very good movie to watch and I am sure that everyone will enjoy it. I also believe that is one of the best Sci - Fi movies of our days and I strongly recommend it. The thing that makes this movie so special is the combination of Science Fiction and adventure with some dramatic moments of our characters.",Interstellar
73,zkonedog,A Tale Of The Human Spirit,10/10,4 March 2017,"""Interstellar"" is a movie about a lot of different things: Exploring the cosmos, family, future stability of planet Earth, time-travel, and science ethics in general. Perhaps most importantly, though, ""Interstellar"" is about something much more important that hasn't been listed yet: the depth of the human spirit.For a basic plot summary, ""Interstellar"" is the story of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a farmer in Earth's future. He isn't a farmer by trade, but rather out of necessity, as in this film's future Earth is perilously close to running out of food, and thus all workers (starting even in the school system) are assigned an occupation based on needs rather than wants. At heart, Cooper is an engineer who loves tinkering with things and dreams of ""something bigger"" than the dust-patch he currently resides on. One day, through a chance series of events, Cooper is introduced to Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a fellow dreamer who has concocted a scheme to leave Earth and settle on a new home. The catch? A trip through an intergalactic wormhole is required, which hasn't ever quite been done successfully. So, saddling up with Brand (Anne Hathaway), the professor's daughter, Coop volunteers for the mission, leaving behind his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet), to await his promised return.After walking out of the theater upon this film's conclusion, the first thought that struck me was ""Wow...that movie had it all"". I don't know if I've ever seen a film so ambitiously tackle so many areas and yet manage to follow through successfully on all of them. I don't care who you are or where you come from...there is something in this flick that will appeal to you.Usually, I am wary of film's like this, as all too often they ""bite off more than they can chew"" and in trying to tackle everything end up doing nothing completely successful. That all changes, however, with Christopher Nolan behind the camera, backed up by brother Jonathan Nolan writing the screenplay. There hasn't been a thing that the Nolan Bros. have worked on that hasn't been utterly fantastic in both scope and execution. In this case, they reach for the stars (in quite a literal sense!) and get there.""Interstellar"" is also a film I would highly recommended seeing in the largest and clearest possible format. I saw a special showing in IMAX 75mm film, and it was extraordinary. The best part? The visuals are not distractions from the overall plot (again, cue the Nolans here). This isn't a ""look pretty but have little substance"" flick (I'm looking at you, ""Gravity""). The visuals (and even the Hans Zimmer score) perfectly compliment the plot/characters.But this film's brilliance doesn't end with a great story or stunning visuals. Great characters provide the emotional drama of any story, and ""Interstellar"" has those in spades. McConaughey gives perhaps the best performance I've ever seen from him. You'd never know he was once mocked as ""king of the rom-com"". Nolan ""vets"" Caine (""The Prestige"", ""Batman Trilogy"") & Hathaway (Catwoman in ""Dark Knight Rises) also are spot-on in their respective roles. Jessica Chastain (playing a role that I can't discuss much for fear of spoilers!) just continues to build her career that was put in motion by a powerful ""Zero Dark Thirty"" performance. At times, even child actor Foy can steal the show with her emotional range. A true gem of a cast, to say the least.As I mentioned earlier, though, perhaps the greatest feat of ""Interstellar"" is its ability to tell a story that will touch your very spirit. Human beings are, by our very nature, curious beings (being gifted with the most advanced brain of any being found in the universe...at least so far) and thus explorers. The ""Space Race"" of the 1960s fed off that instinct, and Nolan capitalizes on it in this film. While by no means being a ""rah rah"" type of film (every character is very grounded with human faults as well), ""Interstellar"" does strike a chord when it comes to the human spirit and the power it can possess.When the Academy Awards start gearing up later this year, I truly hope that ""Interstellar"" and its cast/crew are richly rewarded for their superb efforts all around. This is easily the most stirring experience I had watching a movie in 2014, and I have a feeling it will last for quite some time as well.So, if you are looking for a movie that sets its scope as high as humanly possible and pretty much obtained the goal, ""Interstellar"" is for you. I could continue to go on and on about the things it did well, but it can also be boiled down to one thing: it will make you FEEL on so many different levels. When was the last time a movie made you care so deeply about the characters/circumstances in such a deep, ""human"" way that you felt like you were right beside them? If it's been awhile since you've seen a movie that fits those requirements, then ""Interstellar"" will be a special treat.",Interstellar
74,Floated2,Refreshing and a bright discovery,9/10,11 October 2015,"Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey is a gripping sci-fi adventure that's simultaneously exciting and smart,a combination that is synonymous with director Christopher Nolan's back catalog. If the threads don't quite tie up, and the script occasionally suffers a few hiccups, these are minor flaws that can be easily forgiven, and which Nolan makes up for with craft, exuberance and ambition. The film is confident enough to take us on a thrilling adventure without resorting to huge action sequences, in which the spectacle is delivered on an intergalactic scale, but from a very human point of view. Nolan cuts away from earth in an effective sequence, propelling Cooper and us into the depths of space.

75,eddie_baggins,"A truly awe-inspiring cinematic journey, just let it take you away",10/10,9 November 2014,"A cinematic experience of the highest order, I imagine Interstellar will be many different things to many different people, a movie that will inspire thought, flame imagination and push filmmaking in a varied myriad of new and exciting directions, yet it will also be a film that divides the masses, as we've seen already with critics. While many will herald the vision and scope of Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film yet, there will be equal amounts that find fault in its lofty goals, pick holes in its unashamedly mawkish sentiments and then there's those that think Matthew McConaughey might mumble just a little too much. Taking a very personal approach to a movie I feel deeply awe struck by, I will be one of those many people that completely and faithfully stick by a film that for years to come will be a new benchmark in not only the Sci-Fi genre but movie making as a whole.Naming Interstellar as my most anticipated movie of the year was based on Christopher Nolan's impeccable track record at crafting lofty and masterfully made movies. Over a period of nearly two decades now, the British auteur has oft delved into the human condition, whether it be our memories, our dreams or our dark knights, Nolan has never not reached for the stars and never more so literally than in his most affecting tale here. That critics have found flaws and faults in this journey bemuses me greatly and in saying journey I truly believe this is as close as we could ever come as an audience to such an expedition (not since the Lord of the Rings trilogy had I felt so immersed in a world, in a trek). Critical backlashes to Interstellar bemuses me so as finding flaws here makes me wonder where these critics were for Nolan's previous productions. From Following right through to his most flawed yet thoroughly enjoyable Inception, Nolan's films have always been far from foolproof experiences yet nit-picking them would be taking away from the abundance of cinematic genius that lays so openly before us. Interstellar without question is riddled with moments and with scenarios that are very far from perfect yet what encompasses them is something one can only but marvel at.Displaying a directional tone and an emotional depth that sees a maturity to an already mature behind his years filmmaker, Interstellar sees Nolan open up new dimensions both literally and in a directional sense and there is a heart here I've never seen from Nolan, an emotional core that beats so strongly even as we venture deeper and deeper into the unknown with McConaughey's Cooper and his crew of mankind's saviours. There are ideas here that not only click your mind into overdrive but a beating pulse that drives this adventure into the affecting material it becomes. This is Nolan at his finest and we to see yet another stunning turn from the born again McConaughey with a scene where Cooper watches videos now years old of his family particularly showcasing the power of McConaughey as an actor and he is without question the rock that allows Interstellar to be built upon. There are also visuals to wow the mind here, fantastic cinematography work by new Nolan DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema and a score by Hans Zimmer that must surely be one of the most finely crafted film musical accompaniments of the modern movie era and there is a general sense of overall excellence to a production that clearly wanted to do justice to its masters grand visions.Once more on a personnel note, I was starting to question the power of modern day movies to engage in an entertainment sense, an emotional sense and in a thought provoking manner but Interstellar has wholeheartedly showcased to me once more the power the medium holds when produced in such a splendid manner. Sure Anne Hathaway can be annoying, yes no doubt some of the dialogue may clunk and do we really need our movies 100% scientifically accurate? There criticisms of the film are valid to a point; there also criticisms of a film that also do not in many way shape or form matter. Put your prejudices aside, allow yourself to be carried away on the Endurance and Nolan's cinematic treat will take you on a movie trip unlike any other (even when paying homage to Sci-Fi greats that have preceded it). A startling example of the power off big budget movie making and wonderful vision come to life, Interstellar is not only the big screen movie of the year but an all-time classic that I for one can guarantee will be talked about and studied on for years to come by a raft of not only movie lovers, but movie makers, inspired to reach for the unknown just like Nolan did here.5 A-listers in cryogenic sleep out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Interstellar
76,pennyelenabooks,good enough,5/10,11 July 2015,"In the future, human kind is in danger of running out of food and oxygen. Therefor Cooper agrees to embark on a space journey and travel through a wormhole in order to find a new word for humanity. The thing is, I expected more from the movie. Cristopher Nolan is my favorite director and I know that he could make amazing things, but Interstaller wasn't good enough. It reminded me a little of Gravity and it was too science fiction, with many humanity dilemmas that weren't philosophized enough, with the subject of time being all too confusing and with the main idea being the bond between father and daughter rather than the future of the humanity. However that last one was a refreshing new one, as the movie didn't focus on saving the earth as many other before it have. Though, from some point, you do want it to be more than that, as it seems to have stuck on the family matter. The whole idea of the They is confusing, not to mention the ending, but this is Nolan, the guy who made Insception, so you can't expect to understand it from the first time. Maybe I have to watch it more times in order to appreciate it more. But for now a 5 for the Interstaller.",Interstellar
77,filipemanuelneto,"Engaging, deeply dramatic and scientifically accurate, it has some flaws that are hard to forgive.",8/10,19 December 2020,"This spacial sci-fi film has an interesting and appealing story: in a dystopian future, almost the entire planet suffers from chronic food shortages due to overpopulation and poor harvests. In view of the urgency to feed the world and the inability of Earth to be able to generate more food, NASA secretly creates a program to find more habitable planets in order to save some humans. After a mysterious event at his home, former astronaut Cooper discovers these project and is recruited, despite the opposition of his daughter Murph, having to lead an interstellar spaceship in a voyage to investigate three planets only accessible through a ""wormhole"" next to Saturn.This is a really worth seeing film, despite its script being made of hits and misses and has many confusing situations, which only seem to be within the comprehension of those who have a PhD in Astrophysics. Much more than a sci-fi film, it's a true drama. One of the things that most caught my attention, and that contributes to the dramatic load, was the way that each character has to sacrifice personal interests in favor of a bigger cause, and to decide between what they want and what needs to be done to take the mission forward. This gives the film an emotional charge that is not very usual in sci-fi and that was even exaggerated. I can give an example of those exchanges of messages between the ship and our planet, which, despite being useful in the task of making the characters more human and pleasant, are overly melodramatic. Also the dialogues sound artificial, melodramatic and cliché sometimes. Another feature that pleased me was the concern with scientific rigor, whenever possible (congratulations, Dr. Kip Thorne). However, even here there are shortcomings, with poorly explained space-time advances and setbacks and an extremely confusing ending. And, of course, there are flaws that are already common in cinema, such as the providential way in which the protagonist will ""stumble"" on a secret space project that he should not have known and become the right man for the thing. There are hundreds of movies with similar flaws.The cast is led by Matthew McConaughey, who had won an Oscar before and shows all his charisma and plays wonderfully, particularly the young MacKenzie Foy, very sweet in her role. Anne Hathaway also shone and did well in her role. Equally flawless were Michael Caine, David Gyasi and, particularly, Jessica Chastain. Ellen Burstyn also had time for an interesting and honorable cameo. I didn't like Matt Damon's work, I think his character is one-dimensional and very uninteresting. And I don't understand what the hell Casey Affleck is doing in this film.But who really deserves applause is director/screenwriter Chris Nolan, by the ambitious way in which he planned the film and the determination and commitment he put into it. There is no doubt that he knew how to get the best out of the cast and, despite not having made a perfect script, he created an appealing story that does not put science aside to enter into creative daydreams and delusions. The film is long, the pace is slow and this is not always justified, with the film spending a lot of time on lengthy scenes and sequences, almost without an audible sound. Despite this, it's one of the most visually extraordinary films I have seen recently. Cinematography takes advantage of the best of CGI technology and creates realistic space scenes, which have been expertly complemented by real settings and traditional special effects, which Nolan masterfully uses. In addition to all this, we have excellent sound effects, editing, and Hans Zimmer's extraordinary soundtrack, perhaps one of the best that he has ever created, with a deep and rich sound.",Interstellar
78,leonblackwood,Over complicated and pretty boring! 5/10,5/10,5 April 2015,"Review: I honestly don't think that ordinary, everyday folk like me, are supposed to understand what the hell is going on in this movie because I certainly didn't. I got the main jest of the film but the Nasa jargon went way over my head. Its also really long and I struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when there floating around space talking about things I haven't got a clue about. The main concept of the movie is that a bunch of Nasa boffins want to save the humans species by making them live in space because they can't see a long existence for humans on earth. McConaughey plays the main pilot on the space mission and he leaves his 2 kids behind to try and save humanity. Sounds simple but there are so many other elements which just made the movie confusing. In true Inception style, Nolan went way overboard with the storyline and he could have easily taken out an hours worth of footage. The beginning and the end were interesting but the main space mission was quite boring, until Matt Damon pokes his head out of the woodwork. For a Nolan film, I thought that it looked pretty basic, especially with such a big budget, but you do end up sticking with the plot because you want to see if he gets home. The ending also didn't make much sense to me because I really don't know how Hathaway was able to build a house in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, after much anticipation, I was pretty disappointed with this film but I'm sure that many other film goers will disagree with me. Watchable but not that great!Round-Up: Although I didn't really find this movie that amazing, the performances were really good from the cast and they made there impossible mission seem realistic. The little girl, played by Mackenzie Foy, has had roles in the Twilight franchise and the Conjuring so at 10 years old, she has already made a name for herself. She was a great addition to the cast along with Michael Caine and John Lithgow who also played there characters well. Anyway, I know that the main character McConaughey was really close to his little girl but I found it a bit weird that he didn't ask any questions about his son or his little baby. I also thought that Nolan could have done a better job with the robots which also looked very basic and the spaceships didn't have any attention to detail. At the end of the day, it's no way in the same class as the Batman reboot, which Nolan done extremely well and with movies like Gravity and the underrated Moon in this genre, I honestly think that it could have been simplified and a lot shorter.Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $675millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/adventure movies about a crew of Nasa explorers, trying to save the humans race. 5/10",Interstellar
79,howard.schumann,Sees the possibility of a world beyond our three-dimensional model,8/10,12 November 2014,"When I was growing up, reading science fiction from such authors as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clarke meant discovering new worlds of imagination and wonder. Sadly, what passes for science fiction today is mostly a reflection of a world imprisoned by fear. Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, a visually thrilling film of almost three hours in length, does its best to recapture the wonder of space exploration as envisioned by its earliest dreamers, but even though it falls short, it has the courage to see the possibility of a world beyond our three-dimensional model, a world where love transcends time and space.Co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, Interstellar opens sometime in the future with the earth in the midst of an environmental disaster and the survival of humanity threatened. Dust storms have destroyed the wheat harvests leaving only corn to save the planet from starvation. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a single father and former NASA pilot, now works as a farmer to support his teenage son Tom (Timotheé Chalamet) and daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars,"" he tells his father-in-law (John Lithgow). ""Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" Murph tells her dad, however, that she has seen a ghost in her room that hangs around her bookcase, disturbing objects.When this poltergeist sends a coded message with directions to an underground NASA base, Coop again begins to look up at the sky. He soon discovers that one of his old teachers, Professor Brand (Michael Caine) directs the NASA facility and has a startling story to tell him. Years earlier, five-dimensional beings created a wormhole near the planet Saturn to allow mankind to be transported to a galaxy far, far away when it became necessary.Initial probes identified three potential planets that might be capable of sustaining life and Brand wants Coop to pilot a large ring-shaped ship called The Endurance to rescue a stranded astronaut, find the most suitable planet for colonization, and complete the mission. One of the problems identified by Professor Brand, however, is that there is a nearby black hole that will skew time so that one hour spent on the planet's surface is the equivalent of seven years on Earth.To undertake the mission, Cooper must leave his son and daughter behind with uncertainty as to whether he will ever come back or what age his children will be when he returns. Though the parting is swift, it is not without tears. Leaving his family behind, Coop is accompanied by Professor Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), two astronauts (David Gyasi and Wes Bentley), and the android TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin). Stunning state-of-the art visual technology and the cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema bring outer space closer than ever.We are stunned when the crew encounters mile-high tidal waves rolling over the ship, when we witness the docking with another ship that has spun out of control, visit a planet filled only with water, and another where the surface is blocked by frozen clouds in the atmosphere. There are also emotional high points. For example, when the abandoned astronaut, Dr. Mann (in a surprise appearance by a major star) is overjoyed at being rescued but soon loses his grip on reality. In another moving sequence, Cooper views communications from home that span a period of twenty years (Jessica Chastain plays his grown-up daughter) and realizes that his children have given up the idea of ever seeing him again.Interstellar maintains its tension throughout but, unfortunately, is hampered by poor sound mixing, banal dialogue, and a convoluted story that gives your brain a good working over but is inordinately filled with scientific jargon that eventually becomes off-putting. McConaughey does a creditable job in the lead role, however, but somehow remains aloof and never quite draws us into his character. Both Hathaway and Chastain do the best with the roles they are given, but their characters are seriously undeveloped.Regardless of its flaws, Interstellar is a welcome change from standard Hollywood fare and is definitely worth seeing. Though you may have other interpretations of its meaning, to me the film is about humanity turning away from what is crumbling before our eyes and, rather than endlessly reciting Dylan Thomas' poem about ""going gentle into that good night,"" letting go of our rage and welcoming the ineffable beauty of the light.",Interstellar
80,TheMovieDiorama,Interstellar traverses singularities to signify the unequivocal power of love.,8/10,5 March 2020,"""Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Do not go gentle into that good night"". Humanity faces extinction. Blight plagues the flourishing crops and dust storms envelope the modernised surface. Earth, is no longer habitable. An apocalyptic vision of despair, a species survival succumbing to the hopelessness of one variable that descends tragedies and possibilities in equal measure. Time. It's running out.Former NASA pilot, now farmer, Cooper realises this more than most. The inevitability of destruction. But he pushes on, feeding his optimism. With his daughter Murph, they deduce a pattern caused by gravity variations in her bedroom. Binary code for coordinates to a facility destined to become the first gravitational propulsion space station. ""We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it"", explains professor Brand, whom recruits Cooper to lead an expedition through a precariously positioned wormhole to another galaxy with a multitude of habitable planets. But how? Why? Who created the wormhole? Whose the ""ghost"" that embedded coordinates within Murph's bedroom? The team conclude inter-dimensional ""higher beings"" are guiding them to their destination. Surrounded by a colossal black hole aptly titled Gargantua. Yet the answer, the paradoxical nature of Interstellar, is far more personable than its scientific principles would allude to.Nolan's epic space opera is a grandiose tale of love. Love. ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space"". The bond between father and daughter, savaged by the loss of time that cosmically distanced them to estrangement. Science cannot quantify love. It's undetermined. A burst of emotion that moulds our own mentality, emphasising the human element against the cold stark backdrop of endless space.Nolan embeds the emotionality of adoration within a scientifically-driven narrative, bringing spiritual weight to a mind-bending screenplay. Brand's daughter, Amelia, symbolising that idealism seamlessly, as she believes her lover's planet, Edmunds, to acquire more positive telemetry in comparison to Mann's planet which is still sending out positive readings. She is ultimately ignored based on perceived bias. This intellectual conflict between mind and soul is what powers Interstellar, transforming a visual cosmological adventure into a melodramatic opera.The time dilation, provided by Gargantua, results in Cooper and Murph's eternal separation lasting longer than it seems. By simply performing a slingshot manoeuvre around the singularity, fifty-one years accumulates, resulting in Murph exceeding her father's age. Again, time is running out. It is a commodity. An essential resource. Nolan merges the parental ghosts of Cooper's choice with expendable time, producing an adrenalised pace once they traverse the wormhole. Every minute counts, for it could be a year back on Earth. These rushed aspects cause situations and decisions to become awry, however the principle of Murphy's Law takes precedent throughout. ""Whatever can happen, will happen"".This complements the impossibly dimensional third act, which attempts to answer several paradoxical questions, including Murphy's ghost. Much like the ship's stability when riding through Gargantua, the script just about holds its structure when visualising the tesseract. Undoubtedly complicated to imagine, let alone providing conceivable imagery for audiences to grasp. Yet, for all its dimensional beauty, one important plot point remains inconceivable. The watch. Transmitting quantum data using Morse code by manipulating the second hand of a watch? Surely the data must be enormous in size! And unfortunately it wraps up humanity's crisis all too neatly. It's, and considering the insistence of scientific accuracy, unbelievable. A minor complaint which many will rightly overlook.To transcend love, the performances need to be emotively involved through space. The space between space cannot hinder the emotional output. Fortunately, McConaughey's enigmatic performance capitalised on the human quality of Interstellar's script. The tears of timely loss he expels from his glistening eyes, especially when watching twenty-three years' worth of recordings that his children sent, emanated the power of love. Beautifully understated. Chastain also bringing a vulnerability to Murph's stubborn personality, endeavouring to appease the pressure in saving humanity. Hathaway, whilst exquisite at representing adoration, felt weak in delivering the clunky science jargon. Her character didn't particularly demonstrate her worthy candidacy as a member of the team, distancing our emotional investment for her. Also disliked the literal symbolism behind the aptly named Mann, whose yearning to survive shadows his pragmatic intelligence.The most intricate attribute that Interstellar is equipped with, is Double Negative's visual effects. Gargantua is intimidatingly gorgeous. Quite possibly the single best visual effect to ever grace seismic cinema screens. Effortlessly blending in with Nolan's insistent practical effects, particularly the Endeavour. Both Miller and Mann's planets were landscaped imaginatively to provide variation, and hosted ingenious marionette scenarios for TARS and CASE. Another noteworthy achievement is Zimmer's euphoric score. Again, one of the best scores available. Orchestral beasts, from pianos to organs, shroud the cosmos in grandeur. It unequivocally holds our attention throughout, harbouring a heavenly aura that stares down at Earth's destructive hell. Technically, this is one of Nolan's most ambitious and adept works of art yet.""Lazarus came back from the dead"", states professor Brand. ""Sure, but he had to die in the first place"", replies Cooper. And much like Lazarus, the ability to sacrifice one's self in a bid to sustain humanity's survival beyond our own planet, is the resurrection required to power Interstellar. Time. Love. Space. Complex intangible compositions that provide life to the soul. It gives, and it takes. Nolan's ability to comprehend these three variable and precariously place them into a sympathetic space opera, despite some implausible clunky stumbles, is the ambitious project needed to resurrect imagination.",Interstellar
81,damianphelps,Seriously Good,8/10,5 October 2020,"This was an interesting movie for me.At the time of watching my daughter was about the same age as the character in the movie, so I found myself inserting into the film and relating to the struggles of the father to get to his daughter.
I have never had this experience in a movie before or since.
So I feel in a way the movie review will be slightly contaminated or influenced by external factors...OR is this what should happen more often?So suffice to say...I really enjoyed it!

82,matthewssilverhammer,True Mixed Bag,5/10,14 November 2014,"Interstellar is a mixed bag, one that makes my emotions flip-flop more than a campaigning politician. On the positive side, the scifi technology, sound design, and score are all initially arresting, with the balletic space visuals and effects greying the line between reality and movie-magic. It's undeniably gorgeous and (at times) speechlessly engrossingso why I am struggling? Maybe it's because my love for the positives is only outmatched by my disdain for the negatives: the ponderous dialogue, the Shyamalan-like ""what-a-twist!"" moments, the bulky length, the dishonest ending. Nolan shot for the moon, got distracted by the stars, and missed his target. Interstellar follows a small band of renegade explorers (led by a nicely grounded performance by McConaughey) who, through a wormhole in space, travel to the furthest parts of the universe to find a new planet for humanity to inhabit. The plot is a science/space enthusiast's dream that combines the terror of Kubrick's 2001 and the awe Spielberg's Close Encounters, only Interstellar is more contrived or melodramatic than either. It's a fascinating study of time and the lengths we go for those we love, but the ponderous, self-aware and weepy nature of the heavily thematic discourse softens the impact, most apparently in the unbearably doe-eyed Hathaway. Every Nolan film is an event, and each is worth grappling with. They are filled with big ideas and big visuals in big worlds. If he could self-edit better, Interstellar could easily be a 5 star film that goes down in the annals of scifi movies. Unfortunately, much of the 169 minutes is too gloriously flawed to be fully recommendable.",Interstellar
83,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Another Nolan triumph, even though it's exceedingly ambitious",8/10,11 November 2014,"If Christopher Nolan wasn't already the most daring filmmaker of the 21st century, ""Interstellar"" seals the deal. Somehow, the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" and ""Inception"" director manages to package theoretical physics, space-time travel and a doomsday scenario all in one film that even when it doesn't make sense, still strikes several nerves both in terms of spectacle and compelling storytelling.""Ambitious"" might be the easiest way to describe this 169-minute epic that makes ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" seem artsy-fartsy. And in true Nolan fashion, the ambition involves more than just the science, but in the way these high-brow concepts connect to core human themes and ideas.In a minimally explained but pretty graspable not-too-distant future, Earth is running out of resources to sustain the human race. The need to reinvest in agriculture has wiped out the entire field of technology, which is why Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is no longer a space pilot, but a farmer. But when his daughter, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) discovers some strange gravitational phenomena, it leads Cooper and Murph to NASA, where they discover an operation to find a new home for the human race in a galaxy accessible through a black hole just off of Saturn. When Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway) offer Coop the job of piloting their mission, he accepts and leaves his family, even though he has no idea when he'll return — if he returns. At it's core, ""Interstellar"" is about the lengths we will go to for the ones we love, the choices we will make when guided by love, the least quantifiable force in the universe. A layer above that is the length humankind might go to survive, what we would or wouldn't do as individuals to ensure its continued existence. A layer above that is our purpose as a race and as individuals. Wrapped around this is a lot of science. I mean, a lot of science.As we saw with ""Inception,"" Nolan gets way in over his head explaining stuff most movie-going minds simply can't grasp. If you thought characters in ""Inception"" existed solely to help explain stuff to the audience, ""Interstellar"" has a whole slew of these folks. Somehow, Nolan gets away with it, hoping you'll be blinded by your own curiosity and distracting you with the film's good looks.Technically, ""Interstellar"" could be studied again and again. There's so much to take in beyond the themes and scientific theories and the emotion of characters lightyears apart. Whether it's the computer animation of black holes, the editing of scenes on earth with scenes on a planet in an unknown galaxy, or Hans Zimmer's off-the-wall but powerful score, there's an abundance of technical detail that will undoubtedly be recognized come the Academy Awards. ""Interstellar"" is no less ambitious in these regards as well. Having the privilege of seeing the film in 70mm IMAX, the experience of the film compares favorably with last year's ""Gravity"" only more epic in scope.Nolan's philosophy behind the camera for the space scenes of ""Interstellar"" is to pick his angles and be patient. The major sequences get repetitive in terms of shots and last unusually long in some instances to deprive us of the instant gratification we've come to expect from traditional blockbusters. It creates the desperation of space, the feeling that every decision is crucial and one small thing can send everything spiraling into chaos. The storytelling allows for plenty of this too. Nolan and his brother Jonathan take their time for the first half of the movie, but deliver on the palm-sweating scenes that big movies like this necessitate. I will validate the feelings of those who struggle to take the leaps that that Nolans ask of us in this movie. Given the film is based on theory, it's hard not to question the likelihood of the events and to occasionally check out because you're not able to ""go there"" with the filmmaker. ""Interstellar"" has more of these moments than ""Inception,"" but probably because the concept of ""Inception"" is already far-fetched unrealistic. That film played by its own rules, ""Interstellar"" has to play with the rules of the universe. Yet everywhere the Nolans take the story ultimately services the emotional story deep within the plot holes and incomprehensible events. The film's biggest ""WTF"" moment, for example, proves to be one of its most emotional. It's one thing when a film gets so big it loses sight of its characters, but that does not happen in ""Interstellar,"" as you would rightfully expect from any Nolan film.At the same time, ""Interstellar"" also exposes Nolan's storytelling process, like taking a microscope to something beautiful and seeing the grossness of how it all works. The sheer magnitude of telling this story allows you to see the contrivances that make it all work, in the same way plot holes become more obvious in certain types of films. Everything from the purpose of characters to their names, like Murphy. The dialogue also reveals itself as fitting a category such as expository or theme-building. The use of the Dylan Thomas poem ""Do not go gently into that good night"" is frankly overbearing rather than something that subtly illuminates the film's ideas. On the other hand, look closely enough at the technical elements and they demonstrate what a triumph ""Interstellar"" is in that regard. While you could argue Nolan's storytelling ambitions exceed his reach in this film, you can't levy much criticism at the visual storytelling. Easy to say, perhaps, for someone who saw the film in IMAX 70mm as intended, but what other filmmakers are pushing the artistic boundaries of film on a multi-million-dollar blockbuster scale? James Cameron and Peter Jackson, that's about it.

85,arfdawg-1,NASA's version of Sophie's Choice.,1/10,21 January 2015,"The Plot:In the near future, Earth has been devastated by drought and famine, causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate. When humanity is facing extinction, a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum is discovered, giving mankind the opportunity to widen its lifespan. A group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life. The crew of the Endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown. Coop, the pilot of the Endurance, must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race.NASA's version of Sophie's Choice.It's a horrible movie and I am shocked anyone likes it. Firstly, it doesn't get moving until nearly an hour into this crapola.

86,southdavid,Cosmic,8/10,11 August 2020,"Somehow, I'd missed ""Interstellar"" up to this point, so with the cinemas in the UK tentatively reopening after Covid shutdown, we decided that the IMAX presentation of the film would be a good way to ease ourselves back in to going. Whereas I had some issues with the film, as an IMAX presentation it was certainly an experience.Set in the near future, where a blight is systematically destroying all the crops of the Earth. The remnants of NASA launch a spaceship on a multiyear mission to investigate whether any planets on the other side of a newly appeared wormhole are suitable for human life. This ships designated pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) must decide whether to sacrifice time with his children in the hope of saving the human race.You can't argue that ""Interstellar"" isn't good. It is top notch in every aspect of filmmaking. The visual effects, the score, the performances are all spellbinding. This is one of history's greatest directors bring us his version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - with all the layers, expressionism and concepts that the inspiration has. It also operates as Nolan's love letter to his daughter, about the time he sacrifices away from her to make his movies and how he feels about that. It is a masterpiece.All that said, I didn't love it. Not the way I have done other films, not in the way I have done other Nolan films - and I'm hard pressed to explain exactly why that is. I feel . . detached from it, somehow, maybe there's slightly too much going on? Maybe it's a little contrived at the end? Maybe it's a little too similar to ""Contact"" as well as ""2001""? I'm not sure. I can see the brilliance of it all, but it's something I appreciate rather than adore.",Interstellar

88,Vartiainen,A wasted opportunity,6/10,22 November 2014,"Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one.",Interstellar
89,jtindahouse,Not Nolan's best work but still light-years above the average,8/10,13 November 2014,"I can't help but miss the early days of Christopher Nolan's work with the likes of 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' where his movies were purely mind-blowing, incredibly original masterpieces based purely around story. His Batman trilogy was astonishingly brilliant in it's own way and 'Inception' combined an amazing story with stunning visuals. With 'Interstellar' though I feel he's gone too far towards relying on the visuals and not enough story driving it along.Don't get me wrong, there's a story there, but it doesn't feel original enough by Nolan's standards. The 'space mission to save Earth' thing has been done and whilst admittedly Nolan puts his own twist on it, it still can't be saved from feeling like we've seen it all before (some parts even as recently as Alfonso Cuarón's 'Gravity' just last year).I wouldn't say the near 3 hour run time flies by, but Nolan paces his films so well that he can still get away with a much longer run time than others. 20 minutes probably could've been shaved off this one though to be honest.It's Matthew McConaughey's show from start to finish and we all know he can carry a film. He's as charming as ever and really shows his emotional range at times too. He just seemingly can't make a bad film at the moment. Anne Hatheway on the other hand was a real let down for me. After being absolutely brilliant in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises' as Catwoman I hoped she would equally blow me away in this one. It wasn't to be though. I felt she was flat and almost complacent in the role. The rest of the cast are strong in their performances without anyone stealing the show.It's tough to hold films like this against Nolan. He's got the budget these days and God knows he's earned it. Whether we'll ever see films like 'Memento' from him again remains to be seen. But what I really hope is that he doesn't fall back and become reliant on the big budget carrying his films. I really do trust he's better than that. What project he signs onto next will be very interesting indeed.",Interstellar
90,Turfseer,"Despite great visuals, Nolan's adolescent reverie features a bloated screenplay with too much exposition and 'science-speak'",5/10,13 December 2014,"Let's face it—when it comes to visuals, Christopher Nolan is up there with some of the best directors today (Spielberg, Cameron, etc.). But when it comes to writing, why can't Christopher and his screen writing brother, Jonathan, hire some professional writers to hash out their ideas and sculpt them into a professional screenplay? It's through their insistence on doing all the work themselves, that we end up with the bloated 'Interstellar'.It becomes apparent in the first act just how amateurish the Nolan brothers really are. They posit a future world where climate conditions have turned earth into a virtual dust bowl, on the brink of extinction. Enter Cooper, widowed former astronaut who must save earth from destruction. It's imperative that Cooper get to his space journey in Act Two as quickly as possible, so we can find out what the solution to earth's conundrum is in a reasonable amount of time. But no, the Nolan's insist on dragging things out so that Act I is all interminable exposition.We're introduced to Cooper's family who go on a long-winded drive through a corn field with a flat tire, chasing a mysterious drone. Later, Cooper's 10 year old daughter, Murphy, discovers a 'ghost' in the dust, which turns out to be a coded message from benign aliens who seek to rescue mankind from their big problem on earth (why the aliens are so helpful is never explained but it's rather convenient that stricken earth has someone in their corner!). Cooper and Murphy are led to the secret NASA installation where we're treated to tortured explanations about binary codes, a wormhole which might lead to three different planets on the other side, possibly hospitable to earth colonists, and a very Twilight Zone-like ""gravitational time dilation"", where one hour on the surface of one of the planets that's too close to the wormhole, equals 7 earth years. Throughout the film, it's much more 'tell' than 'show' as the Nolan's insist on explaining all the science behind what's happening, undoubtedly provided mostly by the film's consultant, theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. I was squirming in my seat since it took so long to get to the meat and potatoes of the story: whether Cooper and his crew find out if any of the three planets prove hospitable for earth colonization. Indeed, Act 2 features what Nolan is good at: action scenes featuring some fantastic visuals. On the first planet, prepare yourself as Cooper and crew battle a giant tsunami and later on Planet 2 when Matt Damon, as Mann, a villainous astronaut, attempts to kill Cooper by smashing his visor and then hijacks a shuttle craft and unsuccessfully attempts to dock with the mother ship.Unfortunately, 'Interstellar' features a hokey climax where a now grown Murphy must figure out how NASA space ships can be launched via gravity. Initially, she's despondent when the leader of the NASA project, Brand (Michael Cane), admits that his equation to launch the space ships was bogus. But somehow (and don't ask me how), if Murphy is able to glean additional data from the black hole's 'singularity', she can solve the equation. Enter Cooper who has left (love interest) Amelia, his good-looking co-astronaut, to touch down on the third planet, while he somehow tries to figure out how to communicate with the aliens, so he can send Murphy the crucial data.Again, but don't me ask how, despite the fact that Cooper is out of fuel in his shuttle and finds himself floating in space, he ends up in an extra-dimensional spatial dimension where he's able to communicate with Murphy by sending Morse Code through a watch she had as a child. Cooper is assisted by his robot, TARS, who awkwardly resembles a triple-hinged Gumby. Man and robot successfully communicate with Murphy who is now able to save earth by completing Brand's equation.Nolan's message, however, has nothing to do with the fictional salvation of humanity. Quite the contrary, it's all about 'family'. Cooper's promise to meet up with Murphy after his journey, is fulfilled. The problem is, due to that gravitational time dilation, Murphy is an old woman, now on her deathbed. Cooper and daughter still get to bond and she smartly tells Cooper to join Amelia on the third planet, where presumably they can live happily ever after. 'Interstellar' shines only when Nolan pulls out all the stops with his fantastic visuals. Story wise, a narrative replete with benign aliens and wormholes, is straight out of the original Star Trek play-book. Nolan doesn't help things with all the science-speak, that slows the action down considerably. With judicious editing, 'Interstellar' could have been a better picture but the premise behind it all, is unfortunately that some may term, a 'reverie of adolescence'.",Interstellar
91,bsmith5552,What the Hell is Going On?,6/10,1 October 2015,"""Interstellar"" is this generation's answer to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). As with the earlier film, ""Interstellar"" requires the viewer to have his/her thinking cap on.The storyline has to do with the earth slowly dying and unable to produce the food it needs to survive due to harsh climatic changes. Under the veil of secrecy, a team of astronauts is sent off into space to go through a ""black hole"" in space to seek out new worlds on which earthlings can survive and prosper. The film boasts a large cast and an extensive running time.I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I had a hard time trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Firstly, I had a hard time understanding what star Matthew McConaughy, who speaks in a low mumbly tone, was saying. Secondly I couldn't figure out what Anne Hathaway's character was doing on the mission except to look pretty. She is supposed to be the daughter of top scientist (Michael Caine) and just is not convincing to me. And it's not explained how McConaughy's character is firstly a farmer and secondly a world famous astronaut. And I'm still trying to figure out what Matt Damon's character was doing, why he was where he was and why he tries to eliminate Coopper (McConaughy). Then Cooper ends up back in an alternate universe where he's peeking through a bookcase in his daughter;s bedroom where he sees events from the past as he tries to communicate with his daughter ""Murph"" played by Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Fot and Ellen Bustyn at various stages of her life. As in ""2001"", I became totally confused.Anyway, I have to give the film high marks for it's technical achievements. The special effects are among the best that I have seen. Director Christopher Nolan keeps the story moving along even though he couldn't seem to get McConasughy to speak up.Michael Caine as always gives an excellent performance as the head scientists. At 80 plus he can still act circles around most of the cast. John Lithgow is totally wasted as McConaughy's father as is Anne Hathaway as the token female lead.""Interstellar"" is certainly worth a look if not for for it's special effects then for it's storyline, but if you want to understand what McConayughy is saying, turn on the close captioning if watching on TV.",Interstellar
92,DarkVulcan29,Interstellar succeeds where Transcendence failed.,10/10,13 November 2014,"It manages to be a science fiction tale, and at the same time stay grounded in realism, Is what Transcendence tried to do, but didn't quite get there. The performances where very Oscar worthy, and none the characters never for once seemed annoyingly one noted, when anybody was happy or sad in the film you where feeling it with them.Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) a widowed farmer, and former air force pilot, raising two kids, is chosen by NASA to help another place to live for human race, cause the earth is slowly dying. With the heartbreak of having to leave his family. Will Cooper and his launch team succeed before it's too late? I'm sure the filmmakers did there homework on space travel, cause I don't think there just trying to make another sci-fi adventure, they wanted this to feel grounded in reality has possible. Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain.",Interstellar
93,freemantle_uk,Do not go gently into that good night,10/10,15 November 2014,"Since completing the Dark Knight Trilogy writer/director/God-to-Nerds Christopher Nolan was free to make any project he wanted and chose to work with his brother to make his sci-fi epic and his own version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bold and fantasy film.In the future Earth is dying, the best and brightest have to become farmers. Most crops are failing and the only thing people can grow is corn. Dust storms are constant and Earth is slowing becoming uninhabitable. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a widowed astronaut turned farmer with two children who ends up being asked by NASA to pilot a mission to save mankind by going into a wormhole on Saturn and find a habitable: but doing this meaning leaving his family and possibly never seeing them again.Interstellar is a highly ambitious film and like Inception Nolan threats his audience with the intelligence they deserve. Interstellar is a very complex films with its look at quantum physics, space travel, wormholes and black holes and time and it will require several viewings to truly understand it all. But on a basic level Interstellar story is easy to follow as it is both a story of astronauts going into the unknown to find a way to rescue humanity, the personal story about the relationship of Cooper and his daughter and the important choices people would face in this scenario.The story elements borrowed from 2001: A Space Odyssey as humanity explore an phenomenon left by an mysterious force and a man having to comprehend something beyond human understanding. There is also a similar premise to Danny Boyle's Sunshine as one last crew are sent to save humanity and the Matthew McConaughey sci-fi film Contact.The special effects are fantastic as you would expect and looks glorious, particularly the ice planet. The look of Earth is very much like Looper as Earth as fallen into a state of regression, society looking just to survive and scientific advancement and questions are discouraged. Environmental issues are also touched on as humanity has over used Earth's resources and forced into austerity because of it, people being forced to make do and with the government not investing in research. Interstellar could also been see as a criticism of certain interest groups in America that want to tell children a inaccurate world view and stop scientific research that they see as an offend to their viewpoints.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey Interstellar has themes about human discovery and need for advancement. There are also plot ideas from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Sunshine, Contact and even the Lost in Space film.As well as the sci-fi story there is the human, Earthbound story about the relationship between Cooper and Murph, Cooper's desire to return to Earth and the love the characters share, turning into the love into something quantifiable. The relationship between the two is where the film is most like Contact, as well as its themes about science on Earth. One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Cooper watches a series of videos and he is slowly overcome with emotion, with the camera focused mostly on McConaughey while as he comes overwhelmed.A criticism that has been laid onto Interstellar is that the film sound mixing, with Hans Zimmer's score being very overpowering. But it is fantastic music and Zimmer does some of his best work with Nolan. The music is organ based, being unique and influenced by Bach. And there are times where the film uses silence in space, a homage to Kubrick's sci-fi classic.Interstellar is an ambitious, complex sci-fi film that is rewarding. It is complicated with its scientific theories about space travel and time, yet its story and themes are still accessible for most audiences. A must see for any sci-fi fan.",Interstellar
94,dfranzen70,Shock and awe,8/10,15 December 2014,"Despite an ear-splitting soundtrack that often threatens to drown out important dialog, Interstellar is a profound hit, a love child of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact. Its effects are special, its casting top notch, and its meaning sufficiently ambiguous. In other words, this is a fairly typical Christopher Nolan movie.In the movie, Earth is suffering through historic blight so bad that huge dust storms block out most sunlight and cause major breathing problems for the humans. (And probably the animals, too.) Such has been the sad state of affairs for some time; America in particular has become an agrarian society. Unfortunately, it's a failing society, and it's only a matter of time before the planet is uninhabitable by mankind.Enter ex-scientist/pilot Coop (Matthew McConaughey) who's now a single dad raising two precocious kids along with his father in law. Through a series of plausible coincidences, Coop and his daughter Murphy stumble upon plans to send a manned mission to another galaxy by use of a wormhole - and those in charge want Coop to be the pilot. The idea is that the spacecraft Endurance, piloted by Coop, will fly through the wormhole and land on one or more of three potentially life-sustaining (according to data sent back by probes) planets. Once a suitable planet has been located, citizens of Earth will be transported via space stations - assuming NASA scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) can solve the gravity-is-a-harsh-mistress problem.Aboard the Endurance with Coop are scientists Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romily, and Doyle, along with robots TARS and CASE. That they do enter the wormhole and come out in a wholly different galaxy (the movie should have been called Intergalactic, right?) is not a spoiler. The trouble is that at least one of the three planet candidates is very close to a large black hole, ominously named Gargantua. What if this planet is the best alternative to Earth? Can't be safe to be so close to a black hole; luckily, the planet's mass is large enough to keep it from passing Gargantua's event horizon, so all is good. Well, good as I can make it without explaining what troubles Coop and crew run into, and that could ruin things for you, dear viewer.It's possible some will find this movie to be a little overplotted (yet too vague), with a surfeit of exposition to help things along. This is necessary in part, though, because of two different timelines - that of Coop in the far-off galaxy and that of Murph back on Earth itself. And this is because of a time slip that Coop encounters that slows time for him relative to Earth time, to the tune of one outer-space minute equaling several years on Earth.Admittedly, there were moments when I felt like I'd missed something - that's attributable to how quickly Nolan propels the plot and to how damnably loud the soundtrack is at times. Hans Zimmer's score is excellent, but clearly someone figured that turning it up to 11 was the way to go. I mean, why allow an intricate plot get in the way of booming, sweeping sounds? Also, like Kubrick's 2001, the final twenty minutes can be puzzling. There's not much more that can be said about this that won't reveal something important. I found it fascinating and satisfying and in keeping with the rest of the movie. Perhaps not all loose ends are tied up at the end, but I'm one of those who feels that's a good thing.Nolan's Interstellar is spectacle supported by solid science and a fertile imagination. If the Academy Awards included only five nominees for Best Picture, this film probably wouldn't make the cut - but it should be among the top ten for the year and thus earn such a nomination, along with some for sound and effects.",Interstellar
95,PWNYCNY,An attempt at epic story telling that does not quite make it.,6/10,20 November 2014,"A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.",Interstellar
96,stevendbeard,Good Story But Not Great,7/10,7 November 2014,"I saw ""Interstellar"", starring Matthew McConaughey-Dallas Buyers Club, Amistad; Mackenzie Foy-The Conjuring, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Parts 1&2; Michael Caine-The Dark Knight movies, Jaws: The Revenge; Anne Hathaway-The Dark Knight Rises, Brokeback Mountain and Jessica Chastain- Zero Dark Thirty, The Help.This is a sci-fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan-The Dark Knight movies & Inception-about the not too distant future on Earth, where drought and famine has just about wiped out mankind-I bet you thought it would have been aliens that destroyed us. Matthew is a farmer now but he used to be an astronaut/pilot, before everything went bad. Mackenzie plays his 10 year old daughter. Michael plays a NASA scientist that has been working on a solution to save humanity but he needs Matthew's help. Michael wants to send a spaceship into a blackhole near Saturn that could possible discover a suitable, livable replacement planet for everyone to relocate to. He even volunteers his own daughter, Anne, to go along on the trip-she is a scientist, but it doesn't hurt that she is easy on the eyes. The only problem is that traveling through blackholes is not an every day occurrence, so there is a lot of speculation about how time could be a factor; one day on the other side of the blackhole could be seven years back on Earth and everyone could be dead by the time they completed their mission, if they are not careful. Jessica plays the older version of Mackenzie and she was not happy with her father leaving her, even if it was to try and save the whole world. The special effects are pretty good and FYI, Christopher said that he did not use any green screens for his effects. There are some cool looking robots-I have never seen one like it-and there are several cameo actors that might surprise you. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough. It would have been better if it had been a little shorter-almost 3 hours-but it would be a good rental.",Interstellar
97,meeza,"Yea, I understood it all! NOOOOT! But who cares, still amazing!",9/10,3 August 2015,"Where can I start instilling my praise for Christopher Nolan's mesmerizing film ""Interstellar""? There is lots to love about ""Interstellar"",but keep in mind it's a Nolan film, so there's lots to learn with ""Interstellar"" by viewing it repeatedly and getting a degree in Astrophysics. OK, I was a bit far out there, but again it's a Nolan film so there are plenty of ""come again?"" moments even if your intelligence if plenty above ground. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a widowed father of two, who resides in a future where the crop is dying, and the world is in danger of extinction. Cooper, a pilot and a farmer himself, gets fatefully transported to a secret organization who at that time many thought no longer existed; we call them today NASA. Cooper is asked to go on a mission with space astronaut comrades to find another planet that can inhibit life so the people on earth don't have to face their impending doom on the endangered planet earth. Cooper has a wily 10 year-old daughter named Murph and a devoted teenage son named Tom. Murph is the one that is fully against her dad going on this longtime mission, an age part of the mission is that Coop stays the same age while the earthlings get older; beats Oil of Olay any day I guess! The mission is filled with complexities, deceit, discoveries, and challenges; and they even go and Save Private Ryan; OK, I am stopping there. Will Cooper ever see Murph and Tom again? Well, I am not not going to be an interspoiler by revealing that. Nolan proved once again that he is a master auteur with his direction of ""Interstellar""; but what I was enamored more about his orchestration of the film that he made the picture more as a love & bond story between a father and a daughter through the test of time (and this is big time) and their brawny magnetic force. The technical features of the movie were exemplary including its cinematography, production design, sound, and of course its extra special visual effects. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay was sure complex but very heartwarming, And yes, there was a a bit of a drag in the film's second act, but it all rightfully led to an astonishing third act. McConaughey continues his alright, alright, alright acting with his superb performance as Cooper. Anne Hathaway was outstanding as the fellow physicist astronaut Dr. Amelia Brand; and there was another brand that rated high, and that was the performance of Michael Caine as Amelia's father, Professor Brand who orchestrated the mission. The enchanting Jessica Chastain yet delivered another potent performance as the adult Murph. Other fine supporting work was lifted off by Wes Bentley as fellow astronaut Doyle, David Gyasi as the Black Hole expert Romilly, and child actress MacKenzie Joy as a young Murph. So if you have not done so already, now it's the time to set your cinematic mission set to the stellar ""Interstellar"". ***** Excellent",Interstellar
98,drqshadow-reviews,"Excellent at Many Things, But Too Overzealous for its Own Good",8/10,23 March 2015,"A beautiful, ambitious riddle that tackles the weighty topics of time displacement, space exploration, fatherhood and the end of life on Earth. Not necessarily in that order. Like Christopher Nolan's preceding mind-stompers, Inception and The Prestige, it's a crafty, sprawling creation that feeds and grows based on sheer conceptual might. I found it less accessible and rewarding than those two, however, overreaching in the third act to reel us back in after a few digressions. Most of the climax feels like an ill fit, too, discarding two hours' worth of rigorous scientific detail in exchange for a trippy, convoluted plot device and a fairytale ending. In a lot of ways, it's like a mainstream adaptation of the finale seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a clear inspiration, in that it's bright, blurry, colorful and confusing. Only this time, the static leads to a cookie cutter epilogue, not a blank canvas. Such complaints notwithstanding, I greatly enjoyed most of the ride to reach that point, even if it has a tendency to belabor a point. Nolan's vision of a near-death civilization on our home soil is vibrant and real. His emphasis on the pain of separation and the dizzying potential of galactic time-shifts are powerful and moving. It's a real visual stunner, too, making hay with staggering CG representations of theoretical deep-space star configurations that left me slack-jawed more than once. As a space nerd, that was very cool to breathe in, and seeing practical demonstrations of so many abstract concepts is wonderful.",Interstellar
99,XweAponX,"Huey, Dewey, and Louey's Rendezvous with A Space Oddysey",10/10,26 January 2015,"I would not call this film a ""Remake"" of ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" but there are several references to that film in this one. There are Monoliths (TARS, CASE and KIPP), a two-year trip to a Jovian Planet (Saturn in this case), Scientists in Frozen Sleep, a message of sorts, and the film even shows a kind of psychedelic trip through a spacial anomaly, ending in a scene with an old figure in a bed, Ellen Burstyn as ""Old Murphy"".As I read the IMDb Trivia I note that many of the scenes are shot using actual film and practical effects, a true rarity these days. Also that the ""Wormhole"" look and feel was created using actual scientific data, rather than something just thought up in a CGI house. The Documentary Style of the Film is precisely the right amount, not too much ""shaky cam"" - So it gives the feel of actually being there with the central figures.This film proposes some future calamity (unspecified) that leaves the Earth reverting to an atmosphere that would support ultimately only Anaerobic life forms, aka ""The Blight"" which are choking out oxygen using Life Forms. The Midwest ""Dust Bowl"" of the early 20th Century is referenced, and this film even uses interviews from a Documentary about it.But this film also proposes a world where the 1960-70's trips to the Moon are considered faked, propaganda to cause the Soviet Union to go Bankrupt. A world where Engineers are no longer useful, only farmers. Such a world makes me shudder. This Earth as shown here, does have Technology, even more advanced technology than we have today, but in a correct move, Nolan suppresses it's appearance and importance, at least while we are ""on Earth"" with Coop, Murphy and Tom (older version played by Casey Affleck).A world where Nasa works in secret to perform a thankless, impossible task.This is the first film I have seen with Matthew McConaughey (As ""Cooper"") that I really believed his character, one of the last Engineers and former NASA Astronaut who now uses his skill to fix farming machines. His ""Daughter"" (Named ""Murphy's Law"") is a little doll played by Mackenzie Foy (at 10 years old), Jessica Chastain as a young woman, and the aforementioned great Ellen Burstyn as an old woman. Murphy is a scientist at age 10, she understands the scientific process: Investigate, theorize, prove.But she has a ""Ghost"" in her room that is toppling her books, and sending cryptic messages, In Morse Code and even in Binary in the dust left by an Open Window. Clues. Clues which lead Coop to his former Professor, ""Brand"" (Michael Caine) and his daughter, also called ""Brand"" (Anne Hathaway).I had to laugh at Coop's first meeting with TARS. I can't and won't say anything more.One of the main points of this film is time. Therefore, Hans Zimmer's score is based on 60bpm and variations, depending on how Time is moving on Earth vs for Coop and Brand.One final reference to ""2001"" is how a member of the expedition goes mad, in ""2001"" this was an artificial intelligence. Here, it happens to ""the best of us"". And just as Hal 9000 had created falsified Data, that happens in this story as well.The AI's ""TARS, CASE and KIPP"" could be a reference to Huey, Dewey and Louey from ""Silent Running"", but they are more than just walking, talking Monoliths. They are important characters, they are treated as people, we have to consider them people to believe this. People preprogrammed with the amount of honesty and humor they use.This film as with ""Predestination"" explores the cyclic properties of time, we perceive time as ever flowing only forward. But is that the only way time can flow? Where ""Predestination"" dealt with the ""Grandfather Paradox"", this film deals with Relativity, and Gravity, using Robert A Heinlein's ""Tesseract"" theory (From ""-And he built a crooked house"") to show how the past can be affected by the future. So, both films use elements from The Dean of Science Fiction.There are also things that bring to mind Arthur C Clark's ""Rendezvous with Rama"". It's really about Hope.I doubt if the troll who just handed me a down-vote even read this, or the other two trolls who piped in. I, and several others have been accused of being paid to write a good review, in reality the ones being paid are for the dupe negative reviews. And there are several verbatim dupe reviews in here.",Interstellar
100,alindsay-al,A great sci fi epic,8/10,30 September 2015,"In preparation for seeing the Martian this week I thought I would watch interstellar and I thought it was a great movie. The premise of the movie sees earth dying, so a team of astronaughts go to a solar system to look for a new planet for mankind. Matthew mcconaughey has had a career resurgence recently and he is great in this film. You really feel for his character and sympathise for him as he is separated from his daughter. You root for him throughout the film. The kid actress who plays young Murphy was really good and you felt for her character and her relationship with mcconaughey really carried the film. Anne Hathaway was really good in this film and she brings great emotion to her character and is a great addition. Michael Caine is good, Jessica chastain is good and matt Damon is great as well. The story of coop and murrs relationship is easily the best part of this film and it brings allot of good emotion. However, there isn't too much to the weight to the overall space exploration story. Also towards the end it becomes pretty convoluted and confusing. The script is really good with great drama and a surprisingly good amount of humour in this film. The style of the cinematography is phenomenal as you truly feel like your in space with the crew and it does a brilliant job. However, there is a real pacing issue with this film which in the end makes it a little boring at times. This is a great space adventure that you should see.",Interstellar
101,estebangonzalez10,Nolan delivers an engaging and thrilling sci-fi film,9/10,10 November 2014,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""Interstellar was my most anticipated film of the year so my expectations for this film were huge considering the subject matter and the fact that I am a Christopher Nolan fanboy. Despite the several flaws I found with the script, I wasn't disappointed, but I can understand how this might not work for several audiences. First of all the scale of this film was huge even for a Nolan film. He is such a visionary director and he doesn't settle for simple narratives. The script is so complicated at times that it does make you wonder and ask yourself questions about the logic behind the theories. I'm no expert in quantum physics, but I think Nolan does a pretty convincing job of selling it. He did his research along with his brother and they created a solid sci-fi script. Many people complained about the fact that Nolan sometimes explains his plot to the audience instead of just letting them figure it out, but I find it necessary at times because of the complex structure he elaborates for his films. He enjoys creating these puzzles, but at the same time he helps us put the pieces together. Interstellar is one of my favorite films of the year, but I wouldn't rank it amongst Nolan's top 5 best films. If there is someone who can make a film about physics interesting it's Nolan and he manages to do so in this nearly three hour film. This is by far his most ambitious film, but it does fail at being the ultimate space epic film it so desperately tries to be. However there isn't a dull moment in Interstellar and you are never bored by the world he creates. Unfortunately the final payoff of the film isn't as rewarding as I was hoping it to be. The final 20 minutes of the film are perhaps the weakest part of the movie and it sort of tries to wrap everything neatly at the end like most Blockbuster and commercial films try to do. I know I have complained a bit too much about a film I really enjoyed, but I will now try to explain why this is one of my favorite films of the year. First of all the cast in this film is brilliant. There is no better time to cast Matthew McConaughey in a film than now. He had a fantastic 2013 and MUD was my favorite film of that year. He was also amazing in True Detective so I was ecstatic about him joining Nolan's cast for this film. He is great in the lead role and provides some of the most engaging emotional moments of the film. Despite how highly ambitious the subject matter of the film is and how colossal his task, he manages to keep things small by narrowing it all down to the family dynamics (especially through his relationship with his daughter). He is not saving humanity, he is trying to save his daughter. We believe the sacrifice he is making and it is what makes the humanity aspects of this film work. He is going through an inner conflict of accomplishing his purpose by saving humanity while realizing that he has abandoned his children and is missing being a part of that. Jessica Chastain is also great in this film. She is a talented actress and is at a great moment in her career as well. The most emotional scenes of Interstellar revolve around her relationship with her father (McConaughey). There is a scene midway through the film where he receives a message from her in space that is emotionally gripping. Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway team up once again for a Nolan film and deliver despite not having such interesting characters. Casey Affleck, John Lithgow, and Topher Grace were underused, but they are all talented actors. The cast in this film is superb and they lifted this visionary tale even further. But the casting isn't the only element that Nolan gets right. The visuals in this film are fantastic! I was blown away by the scenes that took place in space. The first act of this film is solid and establishes the present world on Earth in a rather realistic way, but the second act raises the film to another level. The scenes in space and the wormhole are amazing. It also becomes suspenseful and full of tension. Unfortunately the third act didn't work as well for me and the ending was a bit too touchy feely. The score in this film by Zimmer was fantastic as usual and helps build the emotion. So in summary the film is incredibly well shot, it has astonishing photography, superb visual effects, an awesome cast and score, and one spectacular robot. The robot in this film has to be one of the best I've seen. He is also the funniest character and helps lighten the serious tone of the film. I loved Interstellar, but if you had issues with the explanation and exposition in Nolan's Inception, than you will have a similar experience with this film because there is a lot of exposition in space about the theories and what it all means. I have no problem whatsoever with this because it is simply part of Nolan's trademark. He wants us to understand every small detail of the plot because he has worked and studied these things before putting them on the script and he doesn't want the audience to miss out on his creative process. Interstellar doesn't get a perfect grade from me because it isn't as epic as it is trying to be, but I will give Nolan a lot of credit for his ambition and for delivering a fun action thriller with huge ideas.",Interstellar
102,Fluke_Skywalker,Inter-not quite-stellar,6/10,2 April 2015,"Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war.Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout.

103,henry8-3,Interstellar,8/10,30 August 2021,"The world is dying and running out of food, so ex top astronaut pilot (McConaughey) is persuaded to go on a mission through a 'placed' wormhole to find new planets to live on. Time passes slowly where he goes and those left behind, including his daughter grow older why he and his crew mates don't.Seemingly heavily influenced by 2001, this is a spectacular and intelligent sci-fi epic which has a good stab at explaining the future and the concept of time as a physical dimension. McConaughey is believable in the lead and well supported by Hathaway, Lithgow, Chastain, Caine and Foy as the young daughter and the set pieces in space are hugely impressive. It is not without faults - it is too long with with some scenes dragging a little, there are some unconvincing parts such as NASA being in a hurry for McConaughey and waiting to be found by him rather than giving him a call. There is also occasional lapses into heavy handed exposition - eg fellow astronaut Gyasi explaining with a piece of paper to our top astronaut how a worm hole works - he might as well have looked at the screen. Certainly a landmark in sci-fi though.

104,pixrox1,Is this flick really about space exploration . . .,9/10,12 November 2014,". . . or is it more of a high-tech remake of 1960's THE TIME MACHINE? That is only one of many questions raised by INTERSTELLAR (beginning with, ""Is it really so easy to drive a rusted-out Dodge Ram pick-up truck on flat tires through green, roof-high corn stalks?""). Conflating galaxy-connecting worm holes with galaxy-destroying black holes is the least of INTERSTELLAR's brazen pseudo-science. Giving the Astronaut Cooper character the ability to travel back decades in time, by-passing all the Eloi-munching Morlocks, and then communicating with his daughter via a wristwatch that doesn't look very dust resistant (and which has been on a shelf all that time, in the Superbowl of Dust) may strain the belief of some viewers. Furthermore, since Astronaut Romilly knew in advance that he'd be alone in the mother-ship while his buddies were gone a decade or two, why didn't he keep the gray out by setting his sleep capsule on the ""hibernate indefinitely"" setting used by Matt Damon's ""Dr. Mann""? The characters here state that humans were used for this mission rather than robots exclusively because the former improvise better. But you don't see C3PO wrestling R2D2 at the drop of a space helmet as each new frontier is reached in STAR WARS. (This is NOT the case for the people of INTERSTELLAR.) So give me those old time robots, give me those old time robots, give me those old time robots, they were good enough for Luke!",Interstellar

106,jimbo-53-186511,The final 30-40 minutes were thought-provoking and interesting - it's just a shame that the first 2 hours weren't,4/10,7 April 2015,"Earth as we know it is dying and scientists at NASA believe that they may be able to locate an alternative planet for the Earth's population when a wormhole is discovered in space. NASA big wig Professor Brand (Michael Caine) asks Cooper (Matthew McConaughey)if he will lead this mission with a small team to assist him - this is due to Cooper being one of their best pilots when he used to work for them. Even though the mission may last for decades, Cooper makes the difficult decision to sacrifice seeing his family for several years in order to try to save humanity.The first obvious problem with this film is its rather generous running time of nearly 160 minutes. Now I don't generally have a problem with long films, but if the screenplay that you've written necessitates the need for a long run time then for goodness sake give us something to care about. For around 120 of the 160 minutes of this film I was almost completely bored - nothing much happens, the characters in the film are under developed and probably can't even really be classed as characters. The film is far too talky which isn't a problem if the dialogue is interesting, but it just isn't here. A robot comes along to assist the crew, but I'm assuming that the robot was also there for comedy value - it would have been nice if the robot's comedy value was utilised a little more just to try and break up some of the dreary dialogue. As well as being quite boring, there were other problematic aspects within the plot...1) We're told that 'they' have put a wormhole up in space 48 years ago which could potentially take you through into another world or possibly another dimension. OK How do you just put a wormhole in space? Who were these people? I know that this is 'science fiction' and therefore it gives writers a bit more of a poetic licence than other genres, but if you're going to make something up at least explain what you're making up. 2) Was the whole aspect with Matt Damon really necessary? It reminded me of the stupid plot twist in Sunshine where we end up with a crazed lone survivor. It was pointless and added nothing to the story. The film was arguably too long as it was without this unnecessary element being added so by adding it and making an already long film into a film that's way too long really annoyed me.Despite the fact that the first 120 minutes were almost mind-numbingly boring, Interstellar does close strongly and the final 30 minutes or so do provide some interesting and rather thought-provoking revelations.",Interstellar
107,smatysia,Completely ignored tidal gravity,7/10,14 May 2015,"I have always liked science fiction movies, and this one is pretty good. Nice acting, as would be expected from accomplished actors like Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow, and many others. Great visuals, great score, and a partially good use of the science involved, especially general relativity. We can pass on the wormhole, a totally theoretical gravitational phenomenon. But they completely ignored tidal gravity, meaning in an intensely strong gravitational field, such as near a black hole's event horizon, or crossing it, the force is so strong that it will pull the nearer side of an object much more than the far side, thus tearing it apart down to the atomic level well before reaching the event horizon. I'm sure that this was glossed over because it would be fatal to the plot. But it is still a pretty good movie.

McConaughey stumbles upon a sort of NASA headquarters in the back of one of the cornfields and soon embarks on a dangerous mission with Ann Hathaway through a wormhole in order to find a hospitable planet, oh and some time passes.Some of my issues; NASA is in exile right next door to the farm, how convenient, they're living in a dustbowl but only when it suits the filming schedule otherwise its cornfields, sunshine and chasing drones.

113,3xHCCH,Sci-Fi with a Big Heart,10/10,6 November 2014,"The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the ""Breaking Dawn"" films and ""The Conjuring"". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Mama."". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.From ""Memento"", then ""The Prestige"" to ""Inception"", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. ""Interstellar"" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.",Interstellar

This is my second favorite movie of all time and favorite from Nolan. Interstellar has maybe the best assembled cast ever and I will just name few names like: McCounaghey, Hathaway, Caine, Casey Affleck, Timothee Chalamet, Chastain, Burstyn, Lithgow and more. This movie gets better and better with every rewatch and I can tell you I was very confused when I watched it first time. I really like space movies and Interstellar is stunning with amazing score. Interstellar is the same that 2001 was for that time and what it means now, a modern masterpiece.

When Cooper and Murphy happen to run into a NASA facility he's introduced to a plan to save humanity from famine.Sometime in the past, NASA sent several ships through a wormhole to find livable planets. They want him now to run a mission to find out which one of these missions was successful. He agrees, Murphy is angry and doesn't want him to leave and Tom, well, he's a boy, so the movie doesn't care about him.So off he goes with a team of 3 others and some robots. Their challenge is time. They can't waste any because as they are traveling through worm holes at high speeds, years are going by on earth and people are dying. They arrive at the first planet which is nothing but water. There, some girl astronaut who looks like Michael Jackson screws up and gets a teammate killed and wastes precious time. The waves on this planet are gigantic and they are in danger. They escape.Years have gone by on earth. They land on the second planet that is nothing buy ice. They wake up the astronaut there who promises them that there is livable space somewhere underneath. But he has a sinister agenda.Meanwhile we learn that the plan by NASA was somewhat doomed from the get-go, that no one thought this team would make it back to earth. That forces Cooper and the girl to try and solve things on their own. And he's got some help from earth. Murphy herself is now a NASA scientist. And since she was little she has had contact with a ""ghost""--some force that tinkered with gravity to give her messages. She, with the ghost, and Cooper racing at the speed of light, will have to figure out a way to save themselves and earthlings.Interstellar had the worst preview of any movie in recent times. After seeing it several times, I had no intention of watching the movie. But to my surprise Interstellar is actually good. Very good. The visuals aren't that compelling though I must say. Sure, it has some neat scenes, but overall for a space movie, this doesn't take advantage of it. We are not treated to cool sights of nebulas and galaxies. It's a smart movie though that doesn't scare away from the physics, but jumps right into it--relativity, worm holes, speed of light, gravity, string theory, multiple dimensions all make an appearance and are handled well. The physics aren't completely accurate nor is the movie plot-hole free, but it's not as obvious or annoying as in other movies.Despite featuring McConaughey in the lead, it is an engrossing movie that gets you involved for the nearly 3 hours. If properly directed in a ""normal"" role, he can actually deliver. Still, 30-45 minutes could have been easily edited out. It makes you think as well, which is a rarity in Hollywood movies. It doesn't dumb things down. The mandatory scene of someone telling a scientist to ""speak English"" is thankfully absent, truly revolutionary! There are even some philosophically meaningful lines. While I don't appreciate the anti-male aspects, at least it does place a lot of emphasis on family, on parenting, which is sorely needed in Western developed countries that are basically going to go extinct because successful, high-functioning people can't figure out a way to make long-term meaningful relationships work. And that is the even more revolutionary theme of Interstellar. It goes against the Hollywood agenda to destroy the family and to advocate for no-strings-attached, no drama, transactional relationships. Instead it places importance on family in this life, and maybe beyond.",Interstellar
116,aharmas,A Relative Matter,9/10,5 November 2014,"Nolan does it again. He gives us a thought-provoking adventure with basis on the past, present, and possible future of humankind. It makes us ponder about how we came about, where and why we are experiencing the current state of affairs, and the possible outcome. Who is responsible for humankind's future? Who do we relate to and why? Are there any ""they"" out there to guide, help, protect us, or send us to our ultimate fate.""Interstellar"" follows the journey of a man who is selected to find a possible solution to our dying environment. He stumbles upon a secret, scientific project that might take him to another galaxy where he can find a suitable answer to our problems. What he is told, what happens, and what the others do is what makes the tale so interesting and exciting. However, this is not ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters"". It is a original idea that goes beyond what others have hinted at before. What if we dared crossed that border? What if we pushed ourselves a little more? Where does the spiritual and the scientific intersect? Of course, there will be questions about theology, though we hardly hear the characters make any direct references to such entities, but we have a wonderful score that certainly reminds us of what is not being said.In order to get our interests, the outline is laid out, and Cooper (Matthew) is soon on his way to Saturn and the wormhole that will serve as a conduit to the other galaxy where there will be more choices and answers to our questions. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to deal with the possibilities, and that is where the problem lies. On top of that, there are always surprises along the way, and both nature itself and human nature have a way of coming up with more variables than we care to deal with.Soon the pilot and scientists see themselves in worlds where both gravity, time, and energy take on different manifestations from what we are used to. Some storms are just much bigger and powerful than what we are accustomed to, and there is always hidden agendas, unexpected twists to the story, and our ability to try our hardest when things become really complicated.I truly enjoyed the way some natural events and emotions are explained in very detailed scientific lingo, which might prove fresh to some and too challenging to other members of the audience. What strikes me, too is that though the film appears to slow down for some of these exchanges, it never becomes boring. There is always the lure of mystery, of knowledge, and how the mind is thirsty for some sort of stimulation, and in this film, knowledge is power and salvation, and I found it invigorating and hopeful that books are prominently displayed here.We can see how technology allows Nolan to create a new series of visual and sound effects, which play an important part here, and it is very satisfying to see that space looks ""real"", and by the time we are taken through the wildest moments of the ride, we are not disappointed. In fact, the climax of the film is even more complex than expected because here is where technology, faith, and the will to survive blend quite nicely. Nolan keeps his characters real, even when it becomes more challenging to believe there is the possibility of another level to the way we understand the word ""dimension"".All of the performers do excellent work here, with Jessica and Matthew leading the pack. Caine, Burstyn, Hathaway and Damon do very good supporting work, and each one does his/her best to make the story's difficult parts believable and relatable. There is not going to be anyone in the audience who will not believe the way the laws of physics and biology are pushed to the limit because the structure of the film is very intelligent, never going beyond what we understand, and if still a bit incomprehensible, at least it lays the foundations for what might be a more concrete possibility in the future.""Interstellar"" will have you thinking, believing, and loving every minute those people are on the screen. We have a little bit of everything, and the balances are just right because even a power emotion like love is somehow explained in a logical way that will have skeptics believing that it is as real anything that scientists can fabricate in a lab. ""Interstellar"" shows another side of Science Fiction, making it more tangible, more real, more heartfelt, and way different from what we have seen before.",Interstellar
117,peterp-450-298716,Magnificent. Fascinating. Absorbing. Breathtaking. Titillating. Mind-blowing..... Need I say more ?,8/10,20 February 2015,"""I'm not afraid of death.I'm an old physicist-I'm afraid of time.""Magnificent. Fascinating.Absorbing. Breathtaking.Titillating. Mind-blowing.These are just some of the superlatives that I could think of,after watching this masterpiece.It doesn't happen to me often that a film keeps resonating in my mind and I'm still pondering about it after a while.Not that you have to be puzzled about the mathematical content, because it's better to forget about that part.The theory of relativity is brought up once and a while,they end up somewhere in some fifth dimension and you'll be bombarded with theories about black holes and wormholes till you get dizzy.There were some things not really clear to me,but I restrained myself to find plot holes or doubt the accuracy of some mathematical assumptions.It would be quite pretentious to doubt certain statements that are thought out by more enlightened spirits than myself.Although I kind of lacked some imagination in the past to understand certain axioms from solid geometry.So I still have difficulties with the proposition that ""two parallel lines intersect with each other at infinity."" Firstly,I can't imagine the infinite. And second,those parallel lines will still be parallel even at infinite distance.No one on earth will ever claim that they do intersect there,because he once was at that infinite point and saw it with his own eyes.For me it was totally surreal mathematics,my limited intellect couldn't grasp.Hence probably that's why I flunked that exam of solid geometry.But that's beside the point.Nolan managed to make an epic film.A mix of fiction and non-fiction. The set-up to establish a colony on an unknown planet in another galaxy (""To boldly go where no man has gone before"" comes spontaneously to mind) is not really science fiction anymore,given at this time all preparations are made to try the same thing on Mars.But as they plunge into the wormhole,after which they'll be teleported to another galaxy, the non-fiction ends and speculations begin.How it works,is demonstrated in a playful manner,using a sheet of paper and a pencil. Just to keep it simple for someone like me and explain it in an understandable way.But I have to admit that the visualization of this Utopian trip looks stunning.As a counterpart of this high-tech future story,there's also the human aspect whereby Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) has to make a difficult choice between his family and saving humanity.The space trip is preceded by the melodramatic part of the movie which I normally would have described as the corny sappy part.But here I didn't have that feeling at all and the whole was brought well-founded. The sketched relationship between Cooper,Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothée Chalamet) on the dusty ranch,is explained in detail and in a sound manner.In gloomy conditions they try to grow crops.A project that is doomed to fail because fungi slowly eats away all crops on our planet.Cooper,a former astronaut who was employed by NASA,focuses on the agricultural sector now (because there is a need for the production of food, and not space experts) and has constructed a fully automated farm.According to Murph there's a so-called poltergeist who wants to deliver a message.Because of this phenomenon,they discover a secret NASA complex run by John Brand (Michael Caine) who explains to Cooper his exodus theory and asks him to lead this exodus as pilot of the intergalactic spaceship ""Endurance"".Usually the soundtrack of a film leaves me Siberian cold. But in ""Interstellar"" the composer Hans Zimmer created a perfect atmosphere with his compositions. Cooper leaving his family wouldn't be so impressive with the supporting organ sounds missing. Knowing Nolan you can also assume that the appearance of the film would be impressive. And it is. The interior of the Endurance, the landscapes of the three planets, the images of infinite space, the black hole Gargantua, the presentation of the fifth dimension and the trip through the black hole. It all looked very impressive and realistic. Nolan is also known as a supporter of limited-use-of-CGI and it wouldn't surprise me if they made use of huge settings interspersed with tiny elaborated scale models. The planet Miller I personally found the most successful and imaginary result. And finally I just like to mention the accompanying robots TARS and CASE. An innovative design with a humorous communication interface.What remains are the performances, with Matthew McConaughey as main figure. After seeing him at work in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", ""Mud"" and ""Dallas Buyers Club"" (for which he won an Oscar), you can only agree that McConaughey is a talented actor with a peculiar accent who leaves a mark on each film. Personally, I think ""Interstellar"" isn't his most impressive rendition. Yes, he's cut out for the emotion-rich family parts, but as an intellectual NASA astronaut I found him quite implausible. In contrast, I thought Jessica Chastain (as the adult Murph) and Anne Hathaway (daughter of Professor Brand) acted excellent. Casey Affleck (adult Tom), Topher Grace (Murph colleagues and for the umpteenth time in a fairly geeky role) and Matt Damon appear only briefly and each with a different important contribution. The only one who really should feel at home in this film is John Lithgow, for his participation in ""3rd Rock from the Sun"".I could repeat the superlatives I wrote down at the beginning because despite some developments that went beyond my understanding and an ending I wasn't impressed by, this is still a wonderful film that manages to blend both the scientific and the personal feelings of the protagonists perfectly. I'm still wondering who ultimately planted that wormhole near Saturn, that fifth dimension still goes over my head and how Cooper finally succeeded in sending the right information needed to Murph also seemed quite an achievement. And posturing about love as something scientific that knows no boundaries, was also an excuse to give it all a deeper philosophical tone. But ultimately, this is another SF that can be included in the gallery of all those other masterpieces.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Interstellar
118,dierregi,Let's find a new planet to destroy,5/10,9 November 2014,"Roughly divided in three parts and taking place not too far away in the future, the story follows the adventures of Cooper, NASA ex- astronaut turned farmer. Cooper lives in Dusty Somewhere, USA, with his two children (Murph and Tom) and dad in law. Mankind destroyed Earth ecosystems and our heroes are facing dire consequences.Cooper finds ""by chance"" the secret location of the new NASA and he is immediately assigned the very important mission to retrace a bunch of astronauts sent into a wormhole 10 years previously to check some promising planets in another part of the galaxy. End of part one.Part two is about the search. Featuring great images of space travel we follow Cooper and his crew of three down the wormhole. Two crew members are of the disposable type, the other is Amelia, who is in love with one of the astronauts dispatched 10 years previously. As to be expected, the exploration of new planets turns out as risky business.Part three is about Cooper falling into a black hole and finding the fifth dimension, which conveniently allows him to tie a lot of loose knots. Some sort of happy ending ensues, but not the heart-warming type.Much as I like Nolan's films, I found Interstellar the weakest of his production. There are some major plot holes in the script, such as why new NASA does not just call Cooper to guide the new mission instead of waiting for him to ""accidentally"" stumble upon the super- secret location.And do you really need to retrieve data from a computer to find out that an icy, rocky planet perhaps is not inducive to growing crops?The whole first part of the movie feels like wasted time, except for establishing the strong bond between Cooper and Murph. Then we get some cringe-inducing dialog about love, gravity and relativity and constant harping on about the fact that children are our future. I guess this was a personal theme for new dad Nolan, but it boils down to showing what a bright child Murph is, while Tom – also part of humankind future – is nothing more than annoying.Finally, we are shown three new planets, all menacing and uninviting as possible ""home"" for mankind and simultaneously we see how low people can get just to save their skin. Not the most promising scenario for any planet facing abuse and misuse thanks to humankind massive migration.",Interstellar
119,truemythmedia,Almost a Masterpiece,8/10,13 June 2019,"It had been a long time since I'd seen this movie. Actually, I can tell you the exact moment I last watched this: November 7th, 2014 around 7:00 in the evening, in an IMAX theater (I feel like I'm about to start detailing a crime scene). I only saw this movie once before rewatching it for the first time last night. Why? Well, I thought the first two hours and twenty minutes of this film were absolutely spellbinding- brilliantly executed, intriguing and foreboding, intense and sometimes funny; it was perfectly acted, the music was dazzling, and the visual effects were out of this world. Then, the third act came and it took me completely out of the movie. The first time through this film I thought the third act was wildly misjudged and a whimper of a way to end this otherwise epic space odyssey. I disliked the ending so much that even though I owned the film on Blu Ray, I'd never gone out of my way to watch it again until last night. Upon my second watch, anticipating the ending, I enjoyed the film a bit more, but I still maintain that it has problems.

120,AudioFileZ,Modern Day Masterpiece of a Cautionary Tale,9/10,19 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan loves the medium of film and the belief there is an, ultimately, benevolent universal transcendence. It would seem he trumpets this in his film Interstellar. That isn't to say he doesn't explore the evil that is inherent in all mankind. In fact, he, more or less, uses it as a ""jumping-off"" point. It would seem watching the opening act of Interstellar man has in his hubris and greed, pillaged the earth to the point that it's dying - loosing it's ability to support life as we know it. We're further led to realize it's a fast ""slow-burn"" as if we took our current problems roundly classified as ""global warming"" and multiplied it by some grand factor whereby we literally feel the loss on a weekly basis. The main character and his family are struggling to hold on to a modicum of normalcy by pressing on in both the cultural and commercial sectors. Matthew McConahey, , is both a father and a farmer with neither jobs being, particularly, easy or straight forward. While McConahey is struggling with the loss of his wife he must preserve his remaining family of two children and his own father. As a father he's still making the grade, but the earth is failing him in his role as a farmer. He has, like the majority, forgone risky crops in favor of almighty corn. In other words, much like today over half of what defines you is linked to cornthis is a not so hidden metaphor to sharecropping slavery. Control as in you can achieve the threshold of existence whereby anything you might experience just over this point you'll perceive as such a delight you'll falsely achieve a pseudo-psychological state of appreciative compliance. It would appear the human race is in dire danger of extinction by their own hand.Lo and behold, there is a ""black"" government agency not content with the status quo. NASA lives and in this scenario is actually noble in trying to save humanity ,if not on this planet, by seeding it somewhere so it can begin again if all else fails. McConahey (sp?)is a lapsed NASA pilot and in order to save his family he decides to risk everything in a grand mission hinged on the belief he can make a difference. One man's sacrifice as a kind of saviorsounds familiar.Nolan wisely directly sidesteps the duality of government whereby they're both our society's greatest achievement and, ultimately, our enemy - yes our enemy because eventually humanity's dark side taints our very our ability to govern ourselves and survive - no matter what noble men did before. We're left not really knowing how we came to this wretched point, but we get a prescient warning wrapped up in a damn fine sci-fi movie.. How's this for making a movie for mass consumption with intricate messages, layers as if an onion? The devil is, literally, in the details.Now, I'm really not sure what in the final analysis this movie says. Maybe that makes it great because when I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey I remember leaving with the same feeling. In retrospect I was like 12 when I saw that movie and now it seems to be blatantly clear that 2001 let it be known that man in his grandiosity may be his own demise. But, what is Interstellar? It seems like a letter of hope that man will awake and enlighten his own self to assure he not only exists, but thrives. Men can change the course we have set out on by following our primal instincts as opposed to blindly trusting our status quo. Man's spiritual good can trump earthly darkness - and the universe actually allows for this. Well, that's my take on Nolan's opus of a movie. It's accessible, assuredly so by McConehey's impassioned performance, but brilliantly cloaked inside is the message for a kind of revolution whereby each of us calls on our spiritual goodness to rise out of the mire we've been led into. It's the classic Sci-Fi scenario of good and badonly it isn't some dark army seeking to destroy, it's all within each of us. We all matter, we all have power beyond our day to day existence and we need to connect and act if not now then when? Interstellar's final act is one of hope even if it depicts an hour late indeed. This is one multi- layered movie and it, literally, demands repeated viewings. Low-key brilliance which is actually totally brilliant comes to mind. Highly recommended if not because of the complexity, but you may never see cinematography on any higher plane. And I say this just seeing it in standard ""vanilla"" DLP Digital.! Imax analog 70mm should be another revelation altogether.",Interstellar
121,Spondonman,Interminable,7/10,22 March 2015,"I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies – after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually ""there"" or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too.It's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to ""Us"" by ""Them"", whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers – I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge.Basically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt – I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it. Way too long though, it seemed to last decades.",Interstellar
122,masonsaul,Astonishing sci-fi,10/10,24 August 2020,"Interstellar is an astonishing sci-fi film that's thought provoking, emotional, breathtaking and complex. Matthew McConaughey gives an incredible lead performance and Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Mackenzie Foy and David Gyasi all give great supporting performances. Christopher Nolan's direction is phenomenal and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography, consistently visually stunning. The visual effects are flawless. It's extremely well paced and the music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful.

123,Samiam3,"Noble, visually memorable, clunky and hardly stellar but passable.",7/10,19 January 2017,"There is no question that Interstellar is the kind of over ambitious movie that will polarize audiences, but I'll give it credit where it is do.A strong first act is followed by a clumsy and dull second act followed by a climax which is enough of a mind-f**k to partially re-engage you. This is a medium good film, but far from a great one.As far as the cast goes, Interstellar gets fair performances out of Matthew Mcconaughey and John Lithgow. Jessica Chastain is also strong yet strangely distant. Anne Hathoway meanwhile leaves us in the cold. She is as bland as she was in Dark Knight Rises. Nolan as a writer continues to have trouble delivering strong female characters.The dialogue is not the film's strong suit. It is heavy on scientific jargon and forced sentiment and unless you are watching the film with surround sound, almost half the conversation is inaudible. Hanz Zimmer delivers a distinctive score but one that is so overbearing that whole lines of script get lost behind it.The scenes in space are filmed quite admirably. This is movie where you get lost in the cosmos rather than admiring of the CGI quality. Special effects are not meant to be the star of the show. Interstellar sends its characters to planets that resemble real landscapes on Earth, and it doesn't need to dress them up or add flair to make you feel like you are light years from home.I cannot say that Interstellar is not an endurance test, because it is. Though not as exhausting as say the last half of Return of the King, Interstellar is burdened by a very dull middle section with questionable editing decisions and a waste of Matt Damon. The Climax is highly cerebral but might leave you annoyed depending on how hard you try to deconstruct it.The films heart is in the right place. It is an ambitious film with some unforgettable scenes, but it won't age as well as Nolan Batman trilogy, and is an acquired taste that won't be for everyone.",Interstellar
124,davidmvining,A Response to Kubrick,10/10,19 January 2021,"I have a bias for movies that at least seem to take space seriously. I think it explains why I put Contact atop my list of Robert Zemeckis movies, and I think it's why Interstellar is probably going to end up at the top of my list of Christopher Nolan movies. It's the kind of story that I gravitate towards naturally so that when several movies are at about the same level of esteem in my mind, it's the space stuff that just ends up winning out. The movie still needs to be good though, and Interstellar is great.Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is the exact opposite of The Protagonist in Tenet, which I find interesting and points to why one movie works on an emotional level and the other is more purely spectacle. Cooper has a specific emotional touchpoint, his daughter Murph, where The Protagonist pointedly had nothing specific to drive him to save the world in Tenet. I think it's a testament to some of the more traditional building blocks of storytelling and utilizing them in intelligent ways can lead to more complete stories.So, the world is slowly ending. Blight is killing the world's crops. First was wheat. Soon, okra will be gone. Corn's days are numbered. Blight, thriving on the nitrogen in our atmosphere is killing our food supply and will soon turn to our air supply. Something must be done, so the remnants of NASA have devised a plan to use the mysterious wormhole that has appeared orbiting Saturn to find a new home in another galaxy. They had already sent through a dozen people a decade before, giving them three potential worlds on the other side of the wormhole that they could colonize. Cooper, a former pilot turned farmer, stumbles onto this plot when a gravitational anomaly in his daughter's bedroom gives him a set of coordinates in binary for NASA's hidden base on in old NORAD facility.I think this movie ends up working so well in no small part because of how it begins. Nolan takes the time to set up the world, its deteriorating and diminished condition, as well as Cooper's relationship to Murph which carries him through the entire film. It's for her that he decides to go on this mission through space and gravity, which guarantees that he'll miss decades of her life. It's for her that he wants to return home, to a home where not everyone has died. He's contrasted sharply with Doyle, one of the other astronauts. With no personal connections, he looks at the problem with the least humanity, feeling that their priority should be the quickest and easiest solution in order to guarantee that they save what they can.Also on the ship out is Amelia Brand, the daughter of the chief scientist at NASA trying to figure out the problem of gravity that will get them off the ground in great enough numbers to survive as a species. She has a hidden motive: to reach specifically one of the three worlds, Miller's planet, because she loved him before he left. Her specific attachment drives her just like Murph drives Cooper.Back on Earth, Dr. Brand takes Murph under his wing, getting her into college to pursue an education in physics that is in short supply because the needs of the world are so centered on growing food. She grows into a woman and chief student of Dr. Brand, eventually learning that Dr. Brand had known for decades that there was no solution to the problem of gravity, and that there was never any hope for anyone left on earth. Colonization needed to happen with frozen embryos that the ship carried with it to the other galaxy. In her mind, her father left her to starve and die.This movie has a lot of moving parts, and I haven't even gotten to the three planets, but Nolan handles it so deftly that it's easy to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Nolan has such command over the story and its cinematic rollout that one can lose yourself in the story without ever feeling confused. Combined with the embrace of time mechanics as Cooper's adventures with gravity slow time for him, the movie keeps the different threads extremely clear as they progress at different speeds towards a single conclusion.In terms of the movie's treatment of space, this is where the realistic approach to filming the special effects, with an emphasis on camera placements that are attached to ship hulls, really helps enhance the film's sense of scale and danger. We can hear the rattle of the different parts of the ship scrape and hit against each other as the ship enters the wormhole. When the Endurance passes Saturn, it feels tiny in comparison. When Cooper takes the Ranger into the black hole at the end, it feels terrifyingly huge and dangerous.The first planet they visit is a water planet that stretches time by a couple of decades and shows them a planet void of any life despite the presence of water. The second planet is Mann's planet. Dr. Mann was the best of the twelve, the leader, the one who inspired the original group all to go, and his data on his planet was promising and closer to the first planet than Miller's planet. The time on Mann's planet was shown in trailers, but Mann himself was completely hidden. Played by Matt Damon, he ends up being the manifestation of what Amelia Brand described as nature being violent and overwhelming but not evil. The only evil we can find out among the stars is what we bring ourselves. Mann faked all of his data because he couldn't face dying alone. He was completely selfish, as opposed to Cooper's selflessness centered on his family and even Doyle's selflessness unmoored from any humanity.Now, having said all this, I love this movie as it is. The final act in the Tesseract is the kind of heady thing that embraces time mechanics mixed with emotional storytelling that I love, using science fiction to tell a human story. This also represents Nolan's response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Nolan obviously loves Kubrick's film, as evidenced by his efforts to have the movie restored for 4K and his many public comments praising the film, but, watching Interstellar, it feels like he has a certain fundamental disagreement with 2001, especially the ending.In Kubrick's film, humanity evolved through Dave Bowman becoming the Starchild after passing through the Stargate. In Interstellar, Cooper remains decidedly human after passing through the black hole and the Tesseract. There's no great evolution. We're still human. When he finds himself on Cooper Station, dozens of years after he had originally left, boys are still playing baseball and cheering when they hit a flyball through someone's window (in a circular design that directly evokes Rama from Arthur C. Clarke, who co-wrote the script for 2001). We can save ourselves as we are, Nolan seems to be saying. We don't need some outside force to take us another step in evolution. We have it in ourselves to take us further. There are other callbacks to 2001 including the use of Saturn (which Kubrick wanted to use late in production instead of Jupiter, but his special effects team rebelled and kept it as Jupiter) and the overall structure of having the Tesseract in place of the Stargate. I love both movies, and Interstellar is great, but it's not quite 2001: A Space Odyssey brilliant.I think this is Nolan at his height. Technically, the movie is at the top of the heap of cinema magic. Narratively, Nolan found a way to keep the stakes of the movie small enough to understand but still tied to a larger problem. In terms of performance, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best leading man Nolan's ever worked with, imbuing Cooper with such pathos as to invite real emotional connection. Anne Hathaway gives it her all as Amelia. Jessica Chastain is wounded and proud as the adult Murph. Hans Zimmer produces one of his best soundtracks using a huge organ at its core. This is Christopher Nolan exploring his cinematic loves at the height of his power in Hollywood, able to turn a heady science fiction script into a rousing and even touching adventure through space and time that made gobs of money at the box office. This is really why I love Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker in general.",Interstellar
125,jadepietro,Black Hole,4/10,18 November 2014,"This film is not recommended.Interstellar must be renamed to 2015: A Space Oddity. Once there is lift-off, there is much gravitas and solemn beauty in its weightless universe, even if the film bogs down whenever it tethers itself to Earth, its inhabitants, and their on-going battle with global change. (Yes, you naysayers, it was real!) ￼ The film owes its whole existence to the granddaddy of all space exploration films, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Interstellar is similar in its alignment to scientific probabilities, quantum physics, and algorithms with much talk about wormholes, black holes, time travel, and anomalies. The further connection to Kubrick's masterpiece is even more evident with the episodic nature in Interstellar's plot structure, its minimal in character development (except for its lead character), and its overtly pretentious and sanctimonious tone.More odd in its dramatic flourishes than needed, Nolan's film reaches for the heavens but never soars to any level of greatness. The film is earnest, well-crafted, and stylishly directed, but hardly emotionally involving. Blame the overstuffed script (by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan) for the lack of any real tension or satisfaction. Sections of the film just never gel, leading to an ending that is visually stunning and total nonsense. ￼ The film also owes some of its technical prowess to last year's Gravity in its overall visual look. (That film did it all so much better.) Still the visuals are Interstellar's chief asset (with a dazzling set piece set in the fourth dimension that is especially dazzling in the IMAX format). This film is a long-drawn-out sci-fi fantasy, a seriously-minded adventure film that is takes itself too seriously with scientific exposition and high-brow poetic pause that make the film too solemn and corny to truly enjoy. ￼ Now, let's discuss the story and characters a bit. It is the future and Earth is a dustbin with its population dwindling. Our only hope is what lies above. A team of astronauts is assembled to find another world from three other planets in another galaxy on which we can co-habitat. Leading this crew is a man who must have the right stuff, aptly named Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. Coop is a widow raising two small children and obsessing with enough pangs of patriarchal guilt and crying jags to possibly earn another Oscar. Sent by old school scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), who is receiving a weak signal from outer space, he bids adieu to his young wards to go space-ward, leaving the coop and his smart daughter Murph (MacKenzie Foy) and older son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) behind in order to help mankind and save his family from an ultimate death. Time passes quickly for these earthlings (and all too slowly for the audience) as 23 years pass and Murph and Tom have grown up, becoming Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck while Coop stays forever young.￼Of course, there will be snags in this mission. Pardon the pun: it's Murphy's Law. Also on board are other space travelers: Dr. Brand's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who acts more Bedelia than Earhart, a nondescript Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi) as the token African-American astronaut and one of the few minorities on screen. Off they go on their spacecraft named Endurance, an apt title indeed! ￼ The acting is barely adequate and well, under stellar. The characters barely register as real people as they continually wax philosophically about life, physics, love, mathematics, and the pursuit of happiness. Their dialogues never resemble anything remotely convincing. Again, the screenplay's poor plotting and weak characterizations aborts their mission. With Interstellar, the sum of its parts are greater than the whole (or hole). In fact, there seem to be an overabundance of holes in Interstellar: black holes, wormholes, and plot holes, the latter being the most dangerous and unavoidable one due to the Brothers Nolans' sappy screenplay. The episodic structure of the film is unable to connect its story lines to make any logical sense. Nolan's film is a major disappointment. In retrospect, perhaps an even better name for Interstellar might be Close Encounters of the Third Rate Kind. At times, the film is a visual pleasure, fitfully entertaining and thought-provoking in its overall production design. But more often, Interstellar is just dull, uninspiring, and a long, long journey into that good night.

126,Amyth47,"Sweet, Emotional Sci-fi Affair",9/10,13 September 2018,"My Rating : 9/10This along with Gravity are two of the best sci-fi epics of the last 10 years.A beautiful movie to watch, deeply engaging albeit a bit confusing with the science of it. I watched it twice in the theatre just because I didn't really get it fully the first time around and also because it's a great movie experience to be enjoyed on the big screen. I don't think it would have the same impact watching on a smaller TV screen.I have seen majority of Nolan's movies on the big screen and I sincerely think he's an artist that best shines on the biggest canvas.Epic.

127,Seraphion,A rare gem of the modern cinema.,8/10,23 November 2014,"In the near future, climate change takes its toll, slowly but surely wiping out food crops. An ex NASA pilot Cooper and his daughter Murphy comes across a gravitational anomaly, which Murphy thought as a ghost. From one of the anomalies, they get a binary code of a location. They go there and find that it's a new NASA site. As one of NASA's best, Cooper is offered a place for the interstellar journey through a black hole in saving the human race by way of finding a new home, a new planet, for the whole species. He takes the position, despite Murphy's disagreement. He goes with Dr. Amanda Brand, Doyle, Romilly, and the robot TARS. And after fetching the Endurance module and the robot CASE, they go in through the black hole near Saturn to visit the three possible new worlds. Brand also experience the 'ghost' as Murphy did. The first world has a great time-slippage anomaly where an hour spent there equals roughly seven years on earth. Cooper and Brand argue about it, he wants to go there to finish the mission fast and go home to Murphy, while Brand rejects it due to the time slippage. They eventually go there, but immediately gets swept away by a gigantic tidal wave. Brand insists on fetching the data pack, thus taking more time, claiming Doyle's life, temporarily disrupting the lander craft. Seemingly unaffected, they ultimately return to Romilly, who have aged 23 years due to the time- slippage.Finding the first world a failure, they then go to the second world, Dr. Mann's world. They find Mann, literally waking him from death in cryo-stasis. Based on Mann's data, the team decides to continue and set up a pioneer colony site. But Mann, surrendering to his primal urges, betray the team in his effort to go back home, killing Romilly while doing so. Apparently, Mann's data was all lies. He manages to steal one lander and tries to board the Endurance module as the team gives chase. But Mann can't dock the lander well. He ends up blowing parts of the Endurance when he forces to dock. Cooper and Brand manages to reclaim the Endurance though through a risky stunt. Cooper programs CASE to steer the Endurance to the third world. But after Brand gets in the module, Cooper breaks away and sacrifices himself and TARS, after knowing that the life support can support only one person. Cooper only inside his space-suit and TARS with him, gets sucked into the Gargantua black hole. But strangely through the black hole Cooper arrives floating in a crude space-time continuum that's only limited to the back side of Murphy's room back in time. He finds out now he is the Murphy's 'ghost'. He continues on relaying the codes Murphy found in the past, and also the quantum data TARS collected. After all data is code-relayed, Cooper gets sucked out of the continuum. He gets picked up and brought to the space station orbiting Saturn, the human's new home made with Murphy's data. Cooper comes to and gets reunited with the now old Murphy.The story is just a great example of how a great and detailed epic can be told in the modern era. At almost three hours duration, it quite pushes the boundaries of the contemporary moviegoers' boredom tolerance level. But the movie is so great that it quite literally nailed me to the chair, forcing me to hold my bladder almost through the whole third act LOL. It makes the movie detailed on both the emotional and the scientific fiction content. Knowing it's another of Christopher Nolan's sci-fi, I anticipated the movie to be just like The Matrix (1999) and Inception (2010), which I have to watch more than twice to fully understand the grand story. But thankfully Sci-Fi is one of my favorite genres besides Action and Adventure. Thus watching Paycheck (2003), and other astronauts and time-travel movies really pays off.I really like how the movie really pays attention to making a realistic depiction of theoretical quantum physics ideas about black holes, gravitation, time slippage, and ultimately space-time continuum. And those depictions are really great works. Watching at IMAX 2D, I really enjoy the journey through the black hole, the giant tidal wave, and other scenic shots. The movie also takes great advantage of the consequences of the physics, especially the time slippage and space travels issues. The scene where Rom aged 23 years in a few hours, the time-to-time shots of Murphy growing old, the final reunification of Cooper and Murphy are great scenes that really touches the heart, though it sure needs a lot of understanding to discern them.The acting overall is one job. Matthew McConaughey did a great job in both depicting the remorseful father and the calm risk-taker ace pilot. Anne Hathaway did very good in giving balance to the story, although I don't think her role is any more significant than that balancing purposes. Jessica Chastain is also giving great emotional balance to the other angle of the story. Michael Caine's performance quite completes the story for a side villain. But actually Matt Damon really grabs the spot for the complementary villain.My final say is that Interstellar (2014) deserves it's place in the best movies list everywhere. An 8 out of 10 score is my rating for this movie. It's indeed a rare find of a gem among today's modern cinema.",Interstellar
128,RatedVforVinny,Interesting and intelligent.,8/10,11 May 2019,"A a very interesting, intelligent sci-fi thriller indeed. Another i urge anyone interested in, not only the exploration of space (which right now is a hot topic) but lovers of movies with both fine acting and a sharp script. To actually transfer a story this clever to screen is some achievement (and not since '2001' have we enjoyed a computer/robot, with such a warm personality). Leading the cast is the great Mathew McConaughty, who plays a maverick space pioneer.

129,rgkarim,"Familiar Adventure, Awesome Graphics and Lots of Complexity",9/10,8 November 2014,"When you think of Christopher Nolan, you probably think of the Dark Knight trilogy that ended a few years ago. However you may recall a little number called Inception that had a little less caped crusader, and a little more mind twisting. Now that the dark knight has hung up his cape, Nolan and his brother may have produced another epic tale in the form of a space adventure called Interstellar. This genre has been absent in the movies lately, so I was excited to see what the director had in store. Was it good or did it flop? As always I'm happy to share my opinions. Interstellar's story is like most space exploration tales. The earth is dying and the future of humans is once again at stake. Pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is a farmer/engineer is drafted into the rocket program to find other worlds to start colonizing on. Of course this involves leaving his two kids behind, possibly never seeing them again. And just like most space stories, things start to go wrong. Interstellar's plot follows the formula of other space dramas in which things go well at first, but then quickly take a turn for the worse. Yes, like Apollo 13 and other space classics, the crew of this movie faces their fair number of challenges in the unknown. Fans will find themselves gripping the seats, or holding their breath as the drama unfolds, each scene filled with the spectacular orchestra work of Hans Zimmer. Most of the incidents you can see coming, but I'll admit there were a few twists thrown in that surprised even me. Interspersed with the action of the movie, is an intense dialogue that holds a lot in its well-written words. First off is character development, the backstories gradually being revealed as the group progressed on their journey. While some of the traumatic past seemed to be swept under the rug, fans will get plenty of material to help get attached to the characters. For this reviewer, I found that each of the characters got a fair amount of involvement in the movie, and the stories meshed well together to bring a good dynamic amidst the group. However, this reviewer also got a little annoyed about the constant complaining about saving the ones they loved versus completing the mission. WE knew the issues at hand, but Nolan's writing wanted to make sure that we knew how hard it was. This did allow for some good moral testing in the dialog, seeing how far Cooper and the gang would go before diverging from their goals. In addition to these qualities, the writing is also filled with a plethora of scientific jargon that will have the audience either impressed, laughing, or completely stumped. Theoretical physics and quantum mechanics are the backbone of the journey, explaining the principles to how this journey works and why it is such a challenge. I was able to follow most of the dialogue, but determining how accurate and realistic it is, lie beyond my skills. Also there were some well time comedy moments as well, in particular from the robots, that were clever and witty. However, the biggest strength of this movie is the phenomenal effects it has to offer. Interstellar is beautifully crafted to bring the exploration into the unknown to life, with high definition graphics and amazing sound. Planet surfaces are incredibly detailed, from the shimmer of light off the water, to the jagged crags of the icy wasteland. The spaceships themselves have a fair amount of realism to it, though at times things are a bit to blocky or bright to maintain the realism. Even the journey through the wormhole will impress fans as the dazzling lights and whooshing sounds put you right into the fray. Regardless of what part of the movie, rests assure that the visuals are impressive and a big part of what brings the excitement to the movie. Yet for all the good this movie has, including the fantastic acting, Interstellar did have a few weaknesses for me. For one it was a very morbid movie, with so much focus on the negative. This movie has you questioning a lot about the limited time span called life, and may be a bit too depressing for some people. A second weakness was some of the overstretching they did in this movie. I get that the genre is called science fiction, but some of the things they did in this movie were a bit too out there for me. Specific examples can't be shared, but you'll get what I mean when you get further into the movie. If it was meant to be ridiculous, I could accept it, but for the serious tone in this movie, it didn't fit well with me. I'm sure you can guess my next weakness is time length of the movie. Well three hours is a bit much for me these days, and with a slow beginning to set the situation up, it can really drag. However, most of the movie is very interesting and the situations are set up to an extent that most of the movie passes by quickly, though there are still some slow parts. There are a few other things to mention, but let's wrap this up. Interstellar is an awesome movie on so many levels. Yes many will see many similarities to the movie contact, and it does lack some originality. However, this movie is a welcome treat that stands out from the monotonous mess movies have become. I have no doubt this movie will be up for some Oscar awards, especially with the editing involved. This reviewer strongly recommends catching this movie in theaters, though be warned of the length when planning your day. The scores are:Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",Interstellar
130,framptonhollis,"Good, but Overrated",7/10,29 August 2015,"This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!",Interstellar
131,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Interstellar,7/10,11 November 2014,"God bless Michael Caine. I mean who doesn't like Michael Caine. Here's the problem though: he's 81 years old and Anne Hathaway who's 31, plays his character's daughter in Christopher Nolan's latest film. And oh yeah, 23 years pass in said film and Caine is still alive. Wow, he looked pretty good for someone who's reached 104. Uh huh. Anyway, these are some of the aspects that had me scratching my head during 2014's highly ambitious, yet highly imperfect, Interstellar.Watching Nolan's two hour-plus space opera, you can tell that he revisited 2001: A Space Odyssey a few times to obtain a similar vision. His visual palate in regards to ""2001"" is realistically assured yet sort of conventional. So to counter on screen any nods toward the late, great Stanley Kubrick, Nolan also provides his own unique look via his cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema (The Fighter, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). Add a plot over plot over plot screenplay co-written by his brother (Jonathon Nolan) and you've got an exhausting, science fiction epic that could have easily been concocted by the Wachowski brothers (or brother and sister if you've been on a desert island). ""Odyssey"" was made over forty years ago and it forced you to ask questions about time and space. It was just a blueprint where as Interstellar pretty much answers those questions for you. Does that make this fall release a ballsy, forceful masterpiece? Not quite. But it's too involving, absorbing, and monstrously canvassed to not garner my recommendation. Oh and did I mention that Nolan has John Lithgow included in his casting (he plays the main character's father-in-law). Lithgow was in ""2001's"" sequel entitled 2010: The Year We Make Contact. A subtle wink perhaps? Sure why not.Interstellar plays like 1998's Armageddon in a let's-get-in-a- spaceship-and-save-the-world kind of fashion. But Armageddon gives off the feeling of a silly, hyper-active popcorn flick. Interstellar because of its confusing, intricate screenplay, is something completely different. It makes you want to take a note pad with you so you can write stuff down. Are we talking classroom science lecture? Maybe. Are there zingers and comic relief included? Not so much. Nolan's other mind bender Inception, delved deep in the realm of dreams and the quote unquote, ""collapsing of a dream."" Compared to Interstellar, Inception doesn't even scratch its surface. Just paint-by-numbers fodder to be honest.Structured without any containable buildup between scenes on planet Earth and scenes that take place in galaxies that are far far away (the spaceship stuff harbors over 75% of the film's running time), Interstellar begins by depicting astronaut turned farmer, Cooper (played by a miscast Matthew McConaughey who gets his veritable Keir Dullea-on going where no man has ever gone before, literally). The planet is desolate with dust storms and food shortage. The only hope for mankind involves an expedition by which a shuttle takes off through a wormhole finding other planets that humans might be able to survive on. This mission brings Cooper out of retirement and pairs him with a geographer (an underused Wes Bentley as Doyle), a physicist (the excellent Ann Hathaway), another physicist (David Gyasi), and a robot named TARS (just think a friendlier HAL 9000 with walking, outward appendages added on). Cooper, without any real notice, accepts said mission and must leave his intelligent, spunky daughter (""Murph"" played with mature vigor by Mackenzie Foy) and his co-farmer son (Timothee Chalamet as Tom) behind.The scenes where McConaughey's Cooper is on a certain planet for three hours and at the same time (according to time dilation), the Earth has surpassed 20 plus years, are absolutely surreal. I remember hearing about this concept in grade school but it really hits home in Interstellar. This along with Hans Zimmer's intimate film score, are a couple of the vehicle's strongest attributes.But as mentioned earlier, there's the weird realization of Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. I don't know what it is but I just can't see him as an actor playing an astronaut. I mean I'm not faulting the guy. He no doubt gives an adequate performance and well, he's already obtained his coveted Oscar (for the frail transformation of an AIDS patient in Dallas Buyers Club). There are times though when I still feel like I'm watching his Wooderson burnout from Dazed And Confused. He's got that aw shucks thing going on and in my mind, it doesn't quite translate towards NASA. Also, the documentary devices by which various people are interviewed at the beginning of Interstellar's bloated running time are sort of tacky, clichéd, and out of place. These interviews involve elderly people briefly explaining what transpired many moons ago via Earth's awaited demise. Why this dated concept is still used in today's cinema baffles me. It just seems so ten to fifteen years ago in style.Nevertheless, Interstellar is the type of movie that drains you by the time you walk out of the theater. It works on a visual level despite a script that has enough inconsistent sci-fi jargon to spin your head the wrong way (you can also add on Dylan Thomas poetry overkill as well). And the dialogue readings got to the point where if a cast member uttered the words ""plan A"" or ""plan B"" one more time, I was seriously gonna lose it. Oh well, anything directed by Christopher Nolan is worth a look. He's a sophisticated, disciplined filmmaker who's near failures are better than most director's successes. So to end this review, I'll say this: Interstellar is decent but in a sense, not quite a ""stellar"" affair.",Interstellar
132,justin-fencsak,One of the best sci-fi movies ever made despite its pacing.,6/10,19 February 2017,"After the success of his Batman trilogy, Christopher Nolan went back to doing original stuff for the first time in a few years after Inception became his highest grossing original film in the USA/Canada. The result? Interstellar, a movie that has to be seen in IMAX and on bluray to enjoy the amazing visual effects and sound mix. The movie runs a bit longer than his last long movie, The Dark Knight Rises, but unlike that movie, there's not a lot of action. Too many lines of dialogue which can be hard to understand, and lack of romance. The music by Hans Zimmer is worth a listen on Spotify, and the robot in the movie is very funny.

133,Easygoer10,Exceptional,8/10,12 November 2018,"This is a very good film, if not great. I found the final segment, when Cooper basically explains the film's meaning(s) to no one in particular (meaning the audience), to be condescending and annoying. Other than this, it is very good. That said, I don't think it even compares with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which Stanley Kubrick began making exactly 50 years before this film was released. The ""IMDB Top 250 Films"" list, which has almost every Christopher Nolan film he has made in the top 50 (not his fault) doesnt have a single film made by Stanley Kubrick in the top 50. This speaks volumes as to the caliber of amateur ""film critics"" (myself included) to be quite ignorant, in my opinion. So, this film was a letdown for me, but what was I expecting after the same director that made 3 films about ""Batman"", a comic book character (all in the top 50 of course). To show my objectivity, I think his film ""The Prestige"" to be brilliant; my favorite amongst Mr. Nolan's body of work. I gave it 7 stars, and I am being generous.",Interstellar
134,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Entirely Non-Stellar,1/10,12 January 2019,"How could a movie cost $165 million to make while devoting only 5 bucks to a script? I'm no physicist so I'm not going to cry about the faulty science. But at least try to create scenes and dialogue to make the mumbo-jumbo somewhat plausible in a ''suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride"" kind of way. Instead, we're treated to a scene when the astroclowns are freshly in space and through the wormhole when one guy decides to break out the pencil and scratchpad, whereupon he discovers for the first time that every hour down on Planet Moonbeam = 7 years on Earth, so hurry back, mkay?
The ridiculously cumbersome robot. Mumbling Matthew's horrific hairpiece. Anne Hathaway's punchable face. Casey Affleck's even more punchable face. Michael Caine cashing another cheque. All the un-earned tears. The cheap references to Robert Frost and Joseph Conrad. Aaarrrrrgghhhh.
The pretentious philosophizing brings to mind other pointlessly dull movies: Kubrick's 2001 and both versions of Solaris.
Must have been a wild ride at the 3D Moviedome because on television it's a cheap, ponderous melodrama.
Nolan is quickly shaping up to be the most over-rated director since M. Night Shamalamadingong or, more to the point, Andrei Tarkovsky.

135,The_Film_Cricket,"Big, loud, and overloaded with a lot of emotional baggage . . .",5/10,11 November 2014,"If we learned anything last year from Gravity it is that when dealing with movies based on science fact, less is more. Christopher Nolan might have taken some of that to heart with his new space adventure Interstellar. Here is a movie with infinite science and infinite filmmaking skill, but it weighs so heavily on an over-melodramatic bid for the soul of humanity that after three hours we find ourselves too exhausted to care.The story, at its core, is a good one. We're sometime in the near-future when the planet Earth is essentially on life-support (Al Gore will love this movie), suffering a resurgence of the dustbowl as our crops are drying up and humanity has regressed into an agrarian state. Amid this breakdown we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a good-hearted former aeronautical engineer-turned-farmer who is raising a son named Tom, and a daughter named Murphy (if you forget that name, rest assured that Cooper will repeat it at least 300 times before the movie is over).During a massive dust storm, Cooper and Murphy find themselves the recipients of a sign in binary that is either a message from ghosts, God or space aliens. In doing the math, Cooper finds himself among officials at the remains of NASA, and quickly assigned to travel into space, navigate through a worm hole and find another habitable planet to sustain mankind. His crew includes a mournful co-pilot named Brand (Anne Hathaway), a physicist named Romilly (David Dyasi); and a geographer named Doyle (Wes Bentley). Also, two robots named CASE and TARS, who look like monoliths and move like spiders. Actually CASE and TARS are the best things in the movie. They look like the kiosk that you buy your movie tickets from, but they break into smaller parts to perform rudimentary functions –they're really quite impressive.Through a plot that gets way too complicated, the crew find themselves on the other side of the galaxy where they realize that one hour on the new planet equals seven years on Earth. That leads to emotional crises on Cooper's part because he's the one member of the crew with kids back home. Time and relative space begin to spin and bend and twist until neither the crew nor the audience can figure what the heck is going on. This is a very complex story, one that I admit I struggled to follow (and I was able to follow Inception).You find yourself having to look amid large chunks of story to find the main narrative. When you get there you find that through all the gargantuan special effects, music and sound effects, Intersteller is really the story of the disconnection between Cooper and Murphy. Cooper knows that when he gets back home that his daughter will be all grown up (and played by Jessica Chastain) so his mission is really just an effort to make things right. That leads to a long, VERY long scenes in which Cooper mourns the fact that he'll never get to watch his little girl grow up. That would be fine except that the movie belabors the point for nearly three hours, playing the same overemotional notes over and over. Not to be heartless, but when traveling to the other side of the universe, I really could care less about a weepy little girl back home.Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is the one director working right now who really wants to put his vision on screen rather than pander to popular taste. We've seen in Inception , and the Batman pictures that he knows how to tell a grand story using logic and good screen writing. He has a grand vision for what he wants to put on screen, but in Intersteller he goes over the edge. His overbearing emotional output becomes too much for the audience to carry.",Interstellar
136,larrys3,Has Its' Flaws But Still Found it Pretty Awesome,9/10,3 April 2015,"At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.",Interstellar
137,pc95,Awful Accompanying Music,6/10,17 December 2014,"It's not too often that I hold my recommendation for a movie based on its music, but sadly for ""Interstellar"", directed by Christopher Nolan this was the case. The music in a good deal of the movie is so grating and batty that I could not concentrate on the movie-watching, a total distraction and disappointment. It was like a crazed clown playing chord sets on an organ. Had the music been not so obtrusive I would've given the movie a 7/10. It runs too long and needed to be edited down especially at the beginning. The movie is not lacking ambition, and Nolan endeavors to deal with interesting science fiction and science phenomena. McConaughey has been in the better ""Contact"" years ago, so is no stranger to science fiction. Hathaway tones down her role while Michael Caine's character is quite annoying - (spoiler) his death bed gibberish monologue was incoherent and difficult to understand. Mixed 6/10",Interstellar
138,yoggwork,It's almost the best hard science fiction movie ever,9/10,19 February 2019,"It's almost the best hard science fiction movie ever. It's totally beyond expectations. After slowly describing the state of the earth, the theme was presented in peaceful language. Subsequently, the rhythm of the story began to accelerate, climax after climax. Especially the rotating docking part. Not very fond of the end, the explanation of the five-dimensional space is fairly simple, but the final regression is a little far-fetched.

139,brando647,A Reinvigorating Blast of Science in Science Fiction...,9/10,12 December 2015,"There were a lot of quality films released in 2014 and, while it may not be #1, INTERSTELLAR is the most mind-blowing. As much as I loved Christopher Nolan's Batman series, I'm even more excited to see him return to his own devices. The man's got vision and I love seeing it brought to screen, and INTERSTELLAR is his jump into the world of science fiction (for the record, INCEPTION was more action/fantasy than sci-fi). This is an awe- inspiring tale of mankind's last desperate attempt to save itself from extinction. In the not-too-distant future, the world's crops have fallen victim to a new blight and food is becoming scarce. The dying crops have left the soil barren and the nation has fallen into a new era of immense dust storms. Bizarre anomalies in his daughter's bedroom lead former experimental pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to a secret base containing all that remains of the NASA space program. We discover that NASA, led by Cooper's former colleague Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), has begun an operation to try and save what is left of humanity. A wormhole appeared in the vicinity of Saturn almost fifty years ago that links our solar system to a galaxy elsewhere in the universe, and a group of astronauts were sent through ten years ago to scope out potential habitable worlds for relocation. Now it's time to see what they found. The mission: Cooper and Amelia will lead an expedition through the wormhole to investigate the planets where astronauts are broadcasting positive signals, while Professor Brand will remain on Earth attempting to solve the problem of how to subjugate gravitational forces to the point where a station containing humanity's remnants could be launched from the surface of the Earth.Now that his Batman series is down and gone director Christopher Nolan can focus on original material, and I'm thankful for that. I can honestly say I've never been disappointed by the man, and now he's entered one of my favorite genres with the science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR. I love that we're seeing a new trend of ""realistic"" films on space exploration and Nolan has created one of the most ambitious yet. He and his brother Jonathan have done their research and, just in case it's not enough, they had acclaimed physicist Kip Thorne on hand as a consultant on the film's science. The result is a movie that isin my personal opinionintriguing beyond words. The film posits what it would be like to travel through a wormhole and reminds us that the concept of time is not as cut-and-dry as the average person tends to believe. Travelling at insanely high speeds or close proximity to enormous gravitational sources affect the relative passage of time, and this concept is used in INTERSTELLAR as the film's ""ticking clock"". On their adventure across the cosmos, time is moving at a slower rate for Cooper and his team and minutes wasted on their expedition could equate to years lost on Earth. This is one of the most interesting elements of space travel that rarely, if ever, has been portrayed in mainstream film. It makes for a fantastic new challenge in watching this team of scientists, light years away from home, try to accomplish their goal before their mission fails purely because the human race has gone extinct in the time it took them to do it. But, as much as I loved the use of real science in the film, INTERSTELLAR is guilty of some schmaltz in the final act that weakens it.As much as I hate the idea of love being an actual force of the universe, I'm willing to accept it in the world of the film because the cast almost, sort of sells it. Nolan scores another phenomenal cast, pulling a few from previous projects and bringing on some new faces. Matthew McConaughey is in top form as the film's hero, Cooper. A former test pilot, he's called upon by NASA to pilot the craft for this expedition. In doing so, he's forced to leave his two children behind with hopes that he can accomplish the mission and give them a future. The scene where Cooper confronts his daughter with the reality that he will most likely be gone for many years is probably the most powerful in the movie. Not going to lie, that's the part that forms the lump in my throat every time. After films like KILLER JOE and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, McConaughey has sold himself as one of the top modern performers. The man has range and I hate that he wasted his talent for years before emerging as a powerhouse. Anne Hathaway does fine as Amelia Brand but he's pretty unlikeable until later in the movie. She's got noble intentions but her attitude problem and self-serving nature don't serve her well. No worries though; she has her redemption. Jessica Chastain is the third major role in the film as Cooper's daughter Murphy in her adult years. Chastain has an equally meaty role with Murphy having grown into a woman that never quite forgave her father for leaving but continued to work with Professor Brand on his gravity problem. Outside of our main three, the supporting cast (while impressive John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, etc.) is mostly filler. INTERSTELLAR primarily rests on the shoulders of McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway (all right, and a pair of fun robots) and they seem more than capable of caring us through.INTERSTELLAR takes a lot of hits for its climax, which I'll admit is the film's major weakness, but I really enjoy it as a whole. I never feel the expansive running time and, in fact, I'm usually eager to watch it again soon after it's finished. Good science fiction that doesn't rely on laser battles or bizarre alien monsters isn't easy to come by, so Nolan's film is a welcome breath of fresh air to the genre for me.",Interstellar
140,moviexclusive,"Ambitious but pretentious and plodding, Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic strains for greatness, poignancy and monumentality, but falls thuddingly short",6/10,4 November 2014,"How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised.By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time.Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years.Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that ""we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper.Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them.",Interstellar
141,begob,Faith in the unpossible,5/10,1 February 2015,"Ooo - what a disappointment. I expected something new, not this.I was looking for back story on the state of the climate, but it didn't come. Doubt set in when the exploration theme was raised, with the teacher denying the moon landing. Totally out of left-field, nothing to do with the story. Then the hero turns up at the NASA base - I know it's not random and that this thing loops back on itself, but it just felt odd rather than intriguing.Then the main theme is set up - love may be the ultimate survival adaptation. But they did nothing with it.Then we're through the wormhole, but the story shows almost total lack of curiosity about this new environment. No real attempt to present strange worlds. A big wave in ankle deep water - fair enough. A frozen planet - uuuh, Norway?At this point I was hungry for a bit of action. And we did get treachery - clearly flagged (no touchy my computer) - leading to a ... punch up. Exciting.The end is nice and safe, with double-optimism all around. But don't mention the fact we're already running out of cheap oil. Without that the best we can manage is inter-village hog barter with hand-crank shower units. Do I lack faith?",Interstellar

Awful in every single sense - this length of three endless hours, this snotty sentimental atmosphere, these unbearably slow and hammy dialogs. Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why? Why was that so loud and boring? In a word, bad. Bad, bad, bad thing. The worst in years, and I mean it.

144,quincytheodore,"It may not be as mindblowing as Inception, but it paints a clear picture of unworldly desolate journey in very personal level.",7/10,12 November 2014,"Aside from the heavy emphasis of space flight, ""Human is explorer"" as the movie aptly described, the best part of the movie is relationship between humans themselves, mainly between Cooper and Murph. Visual is pleasant, the science is sound and atmosphere is grimly right, although the pace can be pretty slow at times. The movie serves as inspiration and education purpose, captivating audience with not just boring lecture but also with good simulation on how lives can be affected by the prospect of unforeseeable future.Story is very heavy with scientific elements, there is much information to absorb and it could be overwhelming for those who aren't accustomed to sci-fi genre. To its credit, the movie tries to explain many complicated aspects as brief and as clear as possible, it can't be faulted with lack of research. The first act does take some time to roll, but for a good reason. Matthew McConaughey brings top notch acting in recent years, but perhaps his best one is this father-daughter relationship with Murph (Jessica Chastain). It's very believable, dynamic, occasionally amusing and thoroughly emotional. Jessica Chastain pulls off a great performance, better than her older counterparts.Michael Caine, an old time accomplish to Nolan, as Depp to Burton, is fantastic as usual. There's so much depth to his character, much thanks to his natural parental charisma. Anne Hathaway plays as Brand, another astronaut with strong conviction but slight self-doubt. Every character here is flawed, there's no one with hero mentality, and it's more authentic to see them trying to solve their issues with such imperfection. Hathaway is more of a comrade than love interest, someone who shares the unique same fate, her tight suit will be missed though.Writing is quite brilliant, very solid and humorous when needs be. It balances the complex stuff with simpler tone to ensure audience can still relate. Props to writers for making the robotic characters very lively even as they lumber around in metal case. Visual is littered with the gray tone of Nolan. This fits the estranged worlds and empty space, it's less blockbuster than previous galactic voyage of Gravity, but appealing on its own right. Music from Hans Zimmer is undoubtedly excellent, he hits the right tune and delivers some creeping moments of solitude. The overall sound effect is also good, transitioning between vacuum space and mechanic growl perfectly. The movie's production level is sky high.Interstellar is admittedly a bit slow at times, it's inspirational but not as cinematically engaging and entertaining as Nolan's previous works. It manages to create a lonely perspective, a daunting self-reflective insight of human significant, or insignificant in cosmos time, but the best part about the movie is the bonds, might it be parental, platonic or romantic, or even robotic. In the end the star is the humans that make the equation more meaningful.",Interstellar
145,mike48128,"A New ""Space Odyssey"" with Another Confusing Ending",9/10,18 June 2016,"Originally a Spielberg project dating all the way back to 2006, it once again tries to answer several age-old questions such as: should mankind continue, why we are here, and what will we evolve into? Set in the not-so-distant future, but in a curious manner. Not written by Arthur C. Clarke. NASA is a secretive organization and yet cars and trucks look similar to today. After we learn all there is to know about Cooper's life and past, we finally ""blast-off"" after 43 minutes. Cooper is a former NASA pilot and it drawn back into the program by Prof. Brand and his daughter. Cooper leaves behind his family including his children Tom and ""Murph"". His son remains a farmer and she becomes a scientific genius. As the Earth is now a giant ""dust-bowl"" where nothing will grow due to a lack of rain and blight-failing crops. So we journey beyond our universe using a worm-hole provided by what appear to be friendly aliens but turn out to be evolved versions of Mankind. Beautiful images of wonder, space travel, hostile planets. Two astronauts die and a spacecraft is lost. There are robotic lifeforms (like ""HAL"") that can ""walk"" and remind us of the ""monoliths"" from Space Odyssey. Rather than even try to explain it all clearly, Cooper is somehow able to transcend the boundaries of the time-space continuum and communicate with his daughter, Murph, back on Earth. He gives her the gravity equations that allow NASA to move Mankind to another home world past Jupiter. Only Cooper and Brand's daughter return from Space. They are still young while everyone else has aged over 100 years. After saying goodbye to Murph, as she dies of extreme old age, he borrows a transport to rejoin ""Astronaut Brand"" as she attempts to establish a new colony. A good cast including John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Mathew McConaghey, Anne Hathaway, and newcomer Mackenzie Foy as ""Murph"". It's not a ""10"" in my book because the conclusion(s) are very hard-to-follow. The future aliens (us) evolve into Casper-the-ghost-like beings and the two astronauts are sort of ""reborn"" but not exactly as Star-Children. Compelling storytelling with beautiful special effects and action but a bit long and we only get to enjoy about two thirds of the entire intended story. The final answer for our existence is all about love and compassion. War ceased to exist because there was no place for it, as everyone was dying of air pollution and starvation.",Interstellar
146,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Good, but Interstellar never soars.",7/10,22 November 2014,"There's a lot of things to talk about regarding Interstellar. The state of today's blockbusters, Christopher Nolan's position on the pedestal, the McConaissance, the audiovisual experience, or contemporary attitudes towards space travel. Unfortunately Interstellar offers me no spark to talk about them. While I liked the film, I regret to have such a mild reaction to a Nolan. There was a time when his films were the event of the year. Even his last film was an event for the year, but that quickly evaporated upon The Dark Knight Rises' bafflingly clumsy last hour. I still cherish The Dark Knight and Inception, but it looks like he's out of juice. Not that Interstellar is bad, it just never soars like those films do. Perhaps it's due to rampant expectations. To be fair - it works for a lot of people, and I see why, but I found the melodrama of Inception a far more captivatingly emotional experience than what has been claimed to be Nolan finally having a heart.The problem with Interstellar is that it's too sparse. It has great moments, but they're few and far between. Not that the film doesn't initially barrage you with passable exposition, mysteries and introductions, but there isn't a sense of edge of seat jeopardy until the first expedition on a planet. This must be 45 minutes in. Ostensibly, Nolan is concerned with the emotion, that pain of a father torn from his child, but they're not immersive. Powerful in theory, numbed in execution. Again - not bad - just not as good as they could be. I just couldn't invest in this enough to really get under the character's skin. It's got a logic holes that work superficially but not under scrutiny, many of which have already been dissected by the film's most scathing critics. It is a step up from Rises, though I do feel the cinematography isn't as good as it's been claimed to be with it feeling far too blown out and old school. Interstellar suffers under the circumstances, but is at least a decent effort at world building and concept exploration.7/10",Interstellar
147,tomsview,Introspective,9/10,26 October 2015,"I'm not alone in noticing the similarities between ""Interstellar"" and ""Contact"". Along with the space and time travel themes, there is the poignant father/daughter connection in both films. Both movies also have a spirituality, which a film such as ""Prometheus"" never achieves. The effect is enhanced by their respective scores, a beautifully realised one by Alan Silvestri for ""Contact"" and a stunning one by Hans Zimmer for ""Interstellar"". Indeed, this has got to be close to Zimmer's best work; it is such an integral part of the movie and helps the characters express their deepest feelings. Sci-fi movies usually fall into one of two categories; either they are special effects extravaganzas with loads of action and aliens or they are introspective, where much that happens could almost be an hallucination or caused by claustrophobia, time compression or some other phenomenon of space travel. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Moon"", ""Event Horizon"" and ""Solaris"" as well as ""Interstellar"" and ""Contact"" fall into that latter category. Like many of the old episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" they depend more on mood and ideas to make their impact - in the case of the old TV shows, budget and special effects limitations no doubt forced the writers to be more cerebral. But with a big budget film such as ""Interstellar"", the brilliant special effects enhance the profound and complex ideas in the story.""Interstellar"" also fulfils a requirement that Sam Goldwyn once stated - it's the last 5 minutes of a movie that makes it memorable. Like ""Contact"", ""Interstellar"" has a haunting last 5 minutes. To be honest, both ""Contact"" and ""Interstellar"" are long movies and there are passages in each that make you wonder where the story is going, but the powerful final scenes of both films give all the closure needed. It would be hard to think of more emotive scenes than the last ones in ""Interstellar"" - truly inspired filmmaking.Seeing ""Interstellar"" made me want to see ""Contact"" again. I feel they are companion pieces despite being made years apart by different people - although Matthew McConaughey is in them both. ""Interstellar"" is not light fare, it's not mindless effects oriented entertainment. If you are after a movie that will stay with you long after it has finished, it's a trip into inner and outer space well worth taking.",Interstellar

150,Abdulxoxo,A skillful piece of filmmaking,9/10,22 October 2020,"At first I was reluctant to watch this movie 'cause of Nolan's reputation of making overly complicated and confusing films, I prefer staight forward film but this movie is not that confusing as it turned out, well, maybe except the end part. This is truly a masterpiece and surely one of Nolan's best.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is an integral part of the movie and it created so much emotion, feeling, suspense and tension, without his brilliance the movie would not have been as amazing as it was.
The Cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, and the visual effects were a treat to the eyes. The concept was mind-blowing and thought-provoking. The acting was brilliant, Matthew McCartney deserved way more recognition for his performance, the supporting casts were phenomenal as well.
it's hard to get tired of a movie that has the combination of heart, brain, and soul. This movie encapsulate Sci-fi, drama and the care of human spirit rolled into one.

151,michaeltrivedi,Interesting,8/10,11 November 2019,"My first few times viewing this movie I got bored. Even my most recent time I was bored. A lot of intelligent thought was put into it for people who cannot and won't ever understand it, which is basically most of the audience members. But if you pay attention, and become satisfied with zoning in and out, you get something worthwhile. And more emotional than you'd expect.Interstellar is about an earth that has about one generation left before extinction, due to dust storms and lack of farm-worthy land. A man and a group of astronauts are sent into space to a black hole near the planet Jupiter. They are not sure where it goes, but the end result is that it was setup as an entry way to reach habitable planets in the universe. The astronauts land on two of the planets, and many struggles occur. But one sets up shop on the second planet, while the other is found in a hospital recovering from being lost in space for a while.It's a complex storyline, and would take a lot to really explain. The visuals are pretty stunning to watch in theaters. When I watched the black hole scene, I felt something I hadn't ever felt when watching a movie. I felt like I was zapped and pulled through the wormhole. Matthew Mcconaughey did a good job, and so did the rest of the cast. Jessica Chastain really shines, and adds to my liking of her as an actress.But what really fueled the movie was the emotion involved in it. The pride for the lead characters' family and mission. There is a sense that through the infinite amount of nothingness out there, love still remains consistent and unique among humans. The movie also explores the possibilities that absolutely anything is possible by humans. They could live as ""extra-dimensional' beings, and could do things that are beyond man's abilities now. It's universal evolution, to be able to do everything the universe could do and more.It's a fascinating thought, and a kinda well made movie. The boring parts are boring.Watch it.8 stars",Interstellar
152,Screen_Blitz,Visually stunning sci-fi thrill ride,10/10,1 April 2015,"Christopher Nolan has made big impressions on us with his visual effects, in summer blockbusters like The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, Nolan takes his visual style and narrative talent up to the next level in this complex science-fiction thriller. Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner from last year's Dallas Buyers Club) stars as Joseph Cooper, a Texas-native father of two children: daughter Murphy and teenager son Tom, living in the not-too-distant future where the world is running scarce on food supply, crops have declined dangerously low and humanity's day are numbered. He is soon called by NASA to take on a mission to travel through the Galaxy in search of a wormhole that could lead to a new home for humanity. Joining Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anna Hathaway), he struggles against the complexities and perils of the intergalatic environments as well as the decision between saving humanity and the possibility of seeing his family again. This is one of the most visually striking films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan pushes the boundaries of both visual effects and imagination, and brings some eye-popping visuals taking place in outer space you would never forget. The film succeeds not only with ravaging a stunning visual beauty, but also with plenty of scientific food for thought that leaves viewers curious about the nature of astrophysics. The way the film depicts the wormholes and the black holes comes be a cerebral eye-catcher. Now I am not a science guy so I don't how scientific accurate the film is, but it gives a realistic depiction of reality in space. And the plot, though slow at times, manages to associate well with its powerful and scientifically complex story while abandoning its emotional resonance. Some may argue that the plot doesn't quite sustain its 169-minute runtime. Those numbed by the scientific complexity or slow moving storyline may not stay through beginning to end, but there is plenty of strong elements dotted throughout the duration to captivate viewers Let's not forget the incredible performance by Matthew McConaughey. He did a great job on making his character and the bond with his children in the emotional scenes so believable, just by his emotionally driven acting. Anna Hathaway also delivers a performance that stands strong and honorable.Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful sci-fi flick full of surprises and thought-provoking elements that could possibly lead this film to stand as a classic within the next decade. This film is an amazing and striking achievement by Christopher Nolan.",Interstellar
153,Troy_Campbell,"Bold, brainy and beautiful.",8/10,9 November 2014,"With a resume including Inception, The Prestige and The Dark Knight trilogy, base expectations for each new Christopher Nolan film are unsurprisingly high. With the promise of intergalactic exploration and time-and-space-bending action, expectations for the Interstellar are even higher. Alas, Nolan proves he's human after all with a movie that is merely great, rather than his usual standard of phenomenal. There is no doubting his ambition or limitless scope though, with a powerful father-daughter story spanning multiple galaxies, dimensions and time periods. The affecting yarn at its heart is paired with a sci-fi narrative that is deep and intelligent, but occasionally hard to swallow, particularly in the final act. That it's such an effective emotional ride can also be put down to the tour de force performance by Matthew McConaughey; his devoted father who leads the interstellar mission is inspiring, flawed, genuine and eminently watchable. Sitting shotgun in the spaceship, Anne Hathaway is solid, if not spectacular, as a focused and brash astronaut, whilst back on earth Jessica Chastain is superb as a world-class scientist and 13 year old Mackenzie Foy is gripping as McConaughey's plucky daughter. Unfortunately the supremely talented Casey Affleck is not given enough to do and the surprise arrival of an A-lister halfway through feels completely out of synch and, shockingly for Nolan, could even be considered as stunt casting. There's not much to write about the breathtaking visual splendour on offer, as words wouldn't be able to do it justice. Suffice to say Nolan has outdone himself when it comes to his eye for presentation, his employment of 70mm IMAX cameras amplifying the beauty and terror of outer space. Often awe-inspiring and enthralling – but with the odd slow patch and narrative flaw across a bum-numbing 167 minutes – Interstellar is bold, brainy and beautiful, yet not the modern masterpiece that it could have been.",Interstellar
154,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The most beautiful science fiction epic in decades.,10/10,27 December 2014,"Interstellar was an absolutely breathtaking experience for me. I thought the writing, the direction, the score and especially the acting (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy both gave equally phenomenal performances) were all top notch. The film had the feeling of space films from the past, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (as many have said before), but I thought it also had elements of other space adventures, namely Apollo 13 and Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 film).Another thing that truly resonated with me was Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score, that I swear he took (musical) notes on what made John Williams film music so moving, and he gave an equally immersive soundtrack to the film that adds another emotional dimension to Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster epic. Never was the music out of place; it always fit in perfectly with what was going on. It can be its own thing from the film, and it truly tells its own story through sound, something that not many movies have accomplished in quite sometime.The space scenes in particular, have music played to that shows it very much is, and feels like this great expanse of the unknown, an infinite vacuum of an ocean that is full of many beauties and terrors. Hans Zimmer basically added to the already sweeping story of space and time, with an equally overwhelming score that I did not expect to be impacted by it in such a way.Christopher Nolan takes the audience to where they've never truly gone to before until now, through wormholes and the time distortion that black holes can make to nearby planets. It is a big yet beautifully done self-contained adventure. It is not only a fully fledged space epic, but also a cautionary environmental warning for what will happen if we don't leave the Earth when it is a desolate, dust-coated wasteland.I don't know for sure if Interstellar will get the Oscar glory like some were predicting before, but either way, I'm happy that I saw such an ambitious film that has left an impact on quite a lot of people already. It would be nice if it got a Best Picture, Best Actor or Best Screenplay nomination but I don't know for sure; however its music, cinematography and special effects will surely get rightful Academy Awards recognition in 2015.If you want a true space opera that encompasses the wonders of the galaxy, time travel and completely believable characters that need to save humanity, Interstellar is the film for you.Thank you Christopher Nolan. You are such a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Interstellar was such a wonderful gift.P.S. See the film in IMAX 70mm whenever you can, or at the usual cineplex; just see it when you can, folks!",Interstellar
155,ketgup83,Mesmerizing !!!!,9/10,15 November 2014,"The director Christopher Nolan needs no introduction. With expectations always high for every movie of his, every movie has lived up to it and Interstellar is no different. Enough is already known about the plot of the movie. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA pilot turned farmer who lives with his two children and father in a world which is facing increasing trouble in the form of a condition called blight which threatens to wipe out the Earth's food supply. Cooper takes the task of finding a new planet for human beings to migrate before it is too late. The movie is all about the adventurous expedition while also depicting the emotional turmoil that each of the expedition member goes through. The visual effects are stunning and dialogues are excellent as always. This is the simplest way in which such a complex subject can be rendered and Nolan makes sure that the audience doesn't get bored for a second dealing with a subject not so widely known. All the actors have done an excellent job but Matthew McConaughey steals the show. Background score from Hans Zimmer is amazing and adds life to the movie. The only drawback of the movie is the set of assumptions that Nolan is forced to take when dealing with such a subject. The audience may have no clue on what the characters are talking about. If you want to enjoy this movie fully, read a bit on black holes, wormholes and what dimensions mean in a 3D world.https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk",Interstellar
156,antoniotierno,a bit boring,6/10,13 November 2014,"The word I'd use to define this story is contorted..Nolan's intelligence is out of discussion but the problem here is the difficulty of finding a key. All of this effort, all these questions, all of this movie and for what? There is no answer there. Nolan's mind has conceived Memento, The Prestige, Inception, and now Interstellar, always exploring relevant existential questions but there's always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of proportions. The movies are about love, they're spiritually generic and require a lot of production.. But the overall idea is that the viewer doesn't know where the story is going.. Again the previous question, what for..?!

157,RNMorton,wow,10/10,11 November 2014,"Hard to describe what this movie is other than it is definitely science fiction. All that said, as with all great sci-fi the magic is in the relationships, so maybe this is best called romantic sci-fi in the broader sense of ""romantic"". McConaughey plays pilot turned farmer when Earth's climate conditions force mankind to focus on its day-to-day existence. Ghost-like messages to McConaughey's daughter, who he adores, lead him to a hidden NASA base working towards finding other livable planets. Spurred on by his love for his daughter, McConaughey takes off for the stars to try and save those on Earth. That's as far as the trailer goes and that's as far as I will go. With any sci-fi this broad there's going to be some stuff that raises questions, in this case the connection between Matthew and daughter trumps any plot holes. This was just exceptional stuff, I wasn't much of a Matthew M guy before but I sure am on the bandwagon now. Spectacular ""cinematography"" of outer space is just another great plus. Has richly earned its Oscar for Best Picture.

158,miguelneto-74936,Amazing,10/10,1 May 2016,"Interstellar was the last film Christopher Nolan and in my opinion is the best movie of it, and we have to remember that he directed The Dark Knight and Memento, Interstellar has a complex history and will make you think, the visual effects are amazing, the picture is beautiful, the water and ice planets has a spectacular look, the cast is great is Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon and many others, the film is long no more lies tedious, the soundtrack is great especially in the scene in the water planet, towards the end has a very confusing scene, the first 50 minutes before they go to the black hole can be a bit tedious, and the end that his father is the daughter with 90 years or more is very Exciting, Interstellar is one of the best movies I've seen, the film has an incredible view and a very well written story, the film really has things that maybe it would be impossible to do the same with the film technology, more makes this pro scientists discovered.

159,areatw,"Pretentious, self-important and void of fun",6/10,24 March 2017,"'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment.Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time.Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest.

It's a good story with some good dialogues, some nice photographies and some thinkings about the future of the humanity.
I think that the success of this film is also due to the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon.

161,NijazBaBs,not as good as it looks,8/10,12 January 2021,"I am disappointed by this movie. Up to halfway through the movie I wanted to review this with with saying that I am amazed. But 2nd half was total nonsense. Only graphics kept looking good. The story just lost any sense. Too complicated, unclear, fake. Negative ending. I expected much more positive ending with much more stuff resolved, more people alive and younger people, and some simple new planet. Instead, it looks like chaos. 5D, professor admitting some lie, accidents, and some bookcase that just is not convincing. Dull emotional reaction in the end, everything haywire. Only good because of topic, good beginning because it is intriguing, and good look of space and machines. Topic is the best, and very realistic at beginning. Also do not like long movies, this one is longest so far. Much better scientific same or similar movies are Source Code (2011), Geostorm (2017), and Deja Vu (2006). So yes, is this movie filled with wonder, feelings, good topic and science? Yes. Is is filled with something so important and extreme and realistic? Yes. But story is more and more bad towards ending. Could be much simple, much better, much more clarified, and much more positive.

162,proud_luddite,Great in the first half; less so in the second.,6/10,19 December 2018,"In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive.The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either.The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized.The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more.",Interstellar
163,Richie-67-485852,Interpersonal,9/10,6 March 2018,"Nice movie to interact with and then at some point let go and let your inner ponder and wonder out. Cause and effect is displayed very well in this movie making it a good movie to see again just to sip it like fine wine. The earth is dying but mankind has other plans and so it goes with twists, turns and mysteries mixed with human nature hope and space exploration. This is where it gets interesting. Of planets there are no end but what kind are they? This movie touches on that. We learn that Earth is perfect as planets go because everything fits so nicely and holds for billions of years and supports multi-life forms (diversity) which boggle the mind. Finding this elsewhere is not that easy even if you have trillions of choices as we are led to believe in this movie. Good entertainment, visuals and who doesn't like a good space story mixed with time elements plus mankind is running out of time movie? Here it is. make this....

165,hall895,More admired than enjoyed,6/10,26 May 2015,"There is much to admire about Interstellar. It is a film with a thoroughly compelling, thought-provoking story. The visuals are spectacular, the effects are brilliantly done. The performances are all quite good. There are moments of great drama, moments of almost unbearable tension. And there are moments which are genuinely awe-inspiring. This is a film which can fill you with wonder. So why, after seeing the film, do I feel a little bit let down? I am left with the nagging sense that for all the film has going for it Interstellar just is not entertaining enough. And films are first and foremost meant to entertain. This is a noble effort from director Christopher Nolan. He crafted a film which is in many ways quite special. But while you admire what Nolan accomplished is this a film you want to come back to? Do you want to see it again and again? Probably not. It lacks that little spark of entertainment that any film needs to be truly spectacular, to make you want to come back for more.Interstellar unfolds in a future where failing crops have led to starvation. There is not enough food to go around. Earth is failing. Widowed former astronaut Cooper, inquisitive young daughter Murph in tow, stumbles upon a top-secret NASA installation which is conveniently located near his home. There he meets Professor Brand, an old mentor of his who is working to save humanity. Not working to save Earth, working to get humankind off Earth. Lots of talk of wormholes and faraway galaxies where man can start again. Brand needs someone to pilot a spaceship to go check out some of these faraway worlds. No prizes for guessing who is soon strapped in for a rocket ride to outer space.So Cooper takes off on this mission, which comes with the complication that these faraway worlds are really, really far away. Murph is less than pleased that her father is leaving. He promises he'll be back. Of course he does. But of course complications ensue. This mission is a race against time and it is a race Cooper and his crew are losing badly. The fate of humankind hangs in the balance. Heavy stuff. But Cooper just wants to get home to his young daughter. Unfortunately there's the problem of time dilation. There are instances where time on Earth is moving much faster than it does on Cooper's ship and Murph is all grown up and Earth has completely gone to hell and yes this is all a bit confusing. The science in the film is very well worked out but the focus needs to be more on the human drama than the science. There certainly will be plenty of human drama as the story twists and turns through its final act.This gripping story is performed very well. Matthew McConaughey fits the role of Cooper perfectly. A man determined to save mankind but pained by guilt over what he has left behind. McConaughey portrays the inner turmoil in excellent fashion. Michael Caine provides appropriate gravitas as Professor Brand. Anne Hathaway comes off a little cold in playing Brand's daughter, a biotechnologist who travels with Cooper on the epic journey. But that coldness is really part of the character, no fault of Hathaway. And maybe it's not coldness? Maybe it's a steely determination to see the mission through? Anyway, Hathaway and McConaughey play off one another well. Jessica Chastain doesn't show up until well into the film but when she arrives she makes a great impact. The rest of the cast does solid, and in some cases, quite surprising work. So if this fascinating story is performed so wonderfully why does the film not work quite as well as it should? The film's story certainly draws you in but there is that sense that the story could have been told in more entertaining fashion. There are times where the story drags. There is an abundance of clunky dialogue. While the science of the film is well thought out there are times the film seems to get lost in the science. Especially near the end there are moments that are just a little too confusing. So wrapped up in the science of what was possible Nolan seems to have lost a bit of his grip on the human story at the heart of the film. Where the film should be rushing to a brilliant climax it gets bogged down in details. Momentum fades away. Interstellar leaves you with a great appreciation for what Nolan attempted. This is bold, brave filmmaking. Unfortunately as entertainment it falls just a touch short. There is so much to admire about the film. It is certainly well worth seeing once. But, even with all the questions it raises, it is not a film you may be eager to revisit.",Interstellar
166,thekarmicnomad,"Quite epic, very long - a bit touchy feely",6/10,25 May 2015,"This film, although billed as a sci-fi, is really about loss, mortality, apathy and love. The sci-fi element creates a canvass to show off some cgi and add a bit of adventure but little else. The science is where the film shoots itself in both feet. The film tries to justify the plot with elements of theory which is a bit dull and restrictive; yet the story is riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies that it could have got away with if it wasn't taking itself so seriously. The film is concerned entirely around its characters' emotions. So if a big meteor storm is on its way you will get 30 minutes of people worrying about it, 3 minutes of meteor storm then another 30 minutes of people reflecting on its aftermath. This makes a very long film feel even longer. I found this entertaining and it is very well made with great performances and production. I found it unnecessarily long. It also suffers from crop circle syndrome – with an omnipotent technology why not just send a text and stop messing about with charades. My girlfriend didn't want to watch it but instead of hating it she was just indifferent.",Interstellar

As popular and common as this amalgam of professions appears, my relatable background is minimal and is as follows: In high-school physics, I got straight 'A's by copying the two geniuses on either side of me; in astronomy – I got billions and billions of 'F's, and as far as film making goes – I really enjoy the cute kittens gorging the YouTube channels. As expert as I may seem, I feel compelled to askwere there flaws? Hell – don't ask meI don't knowmost importantlyI don't give a Klingon's crack. And that is the extent of my mental masturbation and gasconade. This movie was developed for entertainment – and I for one – was entertained.I don't know who came up with this fable – I am assuming the Nolan Brothers (of course I am sure to be informed I am completely wrong – believe me – I really, really do care) – I am very impressed. These two brothers pretty much created this project from scratch and Christopher Nolan artfully delivered an outstanding product. In other words, the directing and writing was great and original. I see comparisons made between this production and, '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Sorry – other than space and time travel, I cannot see the similarities. In fact, there was one big differencethis movie is very watchable, while ""Space Odyssey' is pretty much drab and boring. Sacrilege! I already know that dissing '2001' is a big sin – for the record, I apologize.Mr. Nolan did an outstanding job with the special effects. Unlike some of his other productions (the 'Batman' Saga, 'Inception', and 'Man of Boring Steal', CGI was kept off center-stage; allowing the story to do the bulk of the work. I am already a huge fan of Mathew 'All Right - All Right - All Right' McConaughey. His performance in this movie is first-rate. Granted, this is probably not his best, but still an awesome job. Besides, I honestly doubt he will ever be able to top his portrayal of David Wooderson, in 'Dazed and Confused.' Here is a reminderWooderson: ""That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age."" I digress.AlsoI really like Anne Hathaway. If you want a woman to star in a safe and comfortable roll – this is the woman for you. Her presence emanates niceness, forcing the entire audience to feel safe, and feel calm, and feel happy and – well – just feel pretty darned good. She definitely played a different kind of character this time. On the surface she seemed to be that same mamby-pamby kind of goody-goody soul, but peel away a layer of skinwatch-out. Hathaway posed one short snippy attack at Coop, and, for me, that strengthened her acting chops –tenfold. The entire cast is strong and well directed. As much as I politically disagree with the man, Matt Damon always turns out impressive performances. This guy can do anything. In this movie, Damon is supposed to be a doctor losing his grip on sanity. Phew! Once you are introduced to the man, you know that you are now face-to-face with the Mad Mayor of Planet Insania. He is one scary dude.Is this movie for everyone? Once againI cannot answer that. Read other reviews and plan from there. If scientific perfection is what you are after – probably not; if you know enough about the Cosmos – I would say no, and if you enjoy clueless and pointless artsy movies about washed up superheroes – definitely not. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and feel this was probably the Nolan Brothers best effort to date. After seeing this, I hope they continue to produce their own material and veer away from pre-made characters. Spectacular package – well delivered – bravo zulu and thanks",Interstellar
170,adamscastlevania2,So well made that the flaws almost don't matter,9/10,25 November 2014,"(89%) One of the more ambitious sci-fi movies of recent years that works both for and against it; although this is a film truly worth tracking down simply because it is such a general cinematic achievement that like ""Gravity"" really needs to be seen in a cinema to be properly experienced. The performances are as one would expect with McConaughey leading well, even if he has been better, and nobody could be accused of letting the side down; while the direction is faultless, and at times totally sublime with many shots that are both haunting and beautiful. Once the final few reels make their rounds the plot takes one too many contrivances that push things a little beyond reason, but this is still an epic trip through time and space that has enough heart and human spirit to get past the bulk of the science flimflam.

171,MuviFan73,"(Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions!",10/10,12 February 2018,"We have grown up in the age of sci-fi where films like Jurassic park and Godzilla (the previous one) gave us the idea of ongoing growth in Science. Myself being a great fan of such a genre, it added to my pleasure. Now when a decade or two has been passed, it is great to have a movie belonging to the same genre coming from world's greatest director Christopher Nolan.
Christopher is famous for movies like Inception and The Dark Night trilogy as well. Interstellar picks up even in the areas where Inception and The Dark Night trilogy could not. The thriller in inception takes away the touch of reality, also visuals in my opinion were not up to mark (I mostly find it that way if they are built by special effects). On the other hand The Dark Night trilogy belonged to superhero genre, thus it stays away from comparison.
I find no shame in admitting that it took me two times to watch the movie to understand it completely. Also this is my second review after deleting first one. Now all I can say it to be as (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions. The story is built by interaction of various interstellar elements like dimensions, black hole, its horizon, relativity, gravity, space, time, worm hole, various worlds, emotions and love. The story is how 'they' from future, interact with present human (probably 'they' from past) to save humanity.
Final verdict: A classic, as it would go down in history.",Interstellar
172,KnightsofNi11,Technically genius,8/10,14 November 2014,"Oh boy. Christopher Nolan you magnificent, complicated, and deep pocketed sonofabitch, you've done it again. You've managed to astound, confuse, and inspire me once more with your boundary pushing, genre defining, works of art. And this time you've taken your wild imagination and jaw dropping spectacle into space, and all I have to say to that is... thank you. I'm weary of going too deep in this review, partly because of the spoilery nature of this and all other Nolan films, and partly because I'm still trying to wrap my head around what I just spent three hours watching. I may do an Interstellar review 2.0 after a much warranted second viewing of the film, but for now what I will say is that this movie is fantastic. There are a very few people in the world who could pull something of this magnitude off, and I'm once again blown away at what Mr. Nolan is capable of accomplishing. Interstellar is one of the biggest technical achievements in post turn-of-the-century filmmaking and it's one of the most impressive visual spectacles I've ever witnessed on the big screen. It also helps when you view this achievement in the glory of 15 proof 70mm film, the format Nolan would have wanted me and all the rest of his millions and millions of viewers to see it in. And quite frankly, there's a reason for that. Interstellar takes place in the near future when the Earth's food supply has run out, and the world is plagued by famine and dust storms. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a pilot turned farmer who is enlisted by whats left of NASA to embark on a mission through a wormhole that could provide the key to saving the human race. Obviously, the stakes are pretty high and it's best that I don't say anything more than that, because the less you know going into this film the better, and that's a fact. Interstellar sets out to accomplish what sci-fi masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Blade Runner accomplished in pairing these themes of space and time with the human condition. I've yet to decide whether it pulls this off in the way the aforementioned films do, but that's something I'll decide after a second watch. What really is amazing is just how much Nolan is attempting to tackle here with Interstellar. It's not just a story about intergalactic travel, time travel, and quantum physics. It's a story about the willpower of the human race and what we can accomplish through love and perseverance. It sounds a little melodramatic, which Interstellar is, but in an age where the human race continues to deplete our planet of its resources, making Interstellar frighteningly relevant, its melodrama that hits home. Interstellar didn't make me cry. It didn't make me cheer. But it did make me feel. It instills inspiration and pride over what we as humans are capable of. From a meta standpoint it's already inspiring to see what the film itself pulls off on the technical scale, which I think makes the fictional accomplishments of the characters within the film feel all the more impeccable and amazing. Interstellar reminds us how much of a fight the human race is capable of putting up. It reminds us that we will ""not go gentle into that good night."" In years to come when real famine and real drought plague the real human race, it will be time to look back to Interstellar to remind ourselves that we don't have to lay down and surrender to mother nature's wrath that we brought upon ourselves. I don't know if Interstellar is a masterpiece, but what I do know is that in one weekend it has already earned a spot in history as one of filmmaking's biggest achievements.",Interstellar
173,gilgongo1980,excellent performance,9/10,8 December 2019,"The movie is mostly intelligent and emotionally (interpersonal). The plot corresponds to the current state of knowledge of physics. As a sci-fi fan I really liked the second half of the movie.

174,jon.h.ochiai,"""Interstellar"" transcends",9/10,27 November 2014,"Matthew McConaughey's widower Cooper consoles his 10 year-old daughter Murph played by wonderful Mackenzie Foy, ""Parents end up becoming the ghosts of their children's future."" Coop, now a corn crop farmer was NASA's best pilot, is embarking on a mission to find a new world for his daughter and her generation. Cooper has no idea if he returns, when that would be-- perhaps decades? Set in the near future in Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" the Earth is dying—sand storms and worldwide blight ravage, and humanity must look to the stars for another home. Nolan captivates with stunning visual imagery like a 500 foot tidal wave on distant planet, but it is his story along with Jonathan Nolan about the love of a father for his daughter that has profound gravity. Anne Hathaway's brilliant scientist Brand echoes this, ""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" Matthew McConaughey is amazing in his down home heroism and authentic compassion. His soothing gravitas is the stabilizing force as ""Interstellar"" goes n- dimensional in Nolan's narrative toward the end. ""Interstellar"" is the awesome epic that works best in its unassuming moments. ""Interstellar"" clocks in at just under 3 hours. The first hour is engrossing earthbound storytelling. Nolan creates the personal mythology for his transformational allegory. In a powerful scene Cooper silences Murph's righteous teachers, telling them of his wife's fate. Cooper along with his rock solid Dad Donald (great John Lithgow) is raising Murph and his son Tom (spirited Timothee Chalamet). They struggle on the farm to survive like everyone else. Emerging genius Murph believes that their house is haunted by ghosts. Murph and Coop's epiphany leads them to the encounter with Dr. Brand (Hathaway) and her father Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Professor Brand trained Coop and asks him to lead the mission to find another world to rescue all of mankind. There is a wormhole, a bend in space connecting over vast distances, near Saturn's moon Titan. Cooper and Brand's daughter (Hathaway) must find a suitable new world, and somehow return home. In the meantime Prof. Brand must solve the equations that allow transport of people from Earth. Once in space ""Interstellar"" embraces the wondrous unknown, and is impeded by the predictable. The conspiracy threads become a distraction. Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is the brilliant astrophysicist helping Brand (Caine) solve the relativity paradox. Chastain's Murph's achievements are the aftermath of her anger for her father leaving her. Chastain is powerful. McConaughey mesmerizes as he watches videos of his children grown and having their lives—without him. Famed Physicist Kip Thorne oversaw the science of ""Interstellar"" for Christopher Nolan. We have amazing insights about Black Holes and special relativity. The visuals are stunning. However, the story gets really confusing as we literally go beyond 3 dimensions, as the plot holes emerge and the conspiracy narrative distracts. Matt Damon appears as Dr. Mann and is commanding, but seems more of a plot device. Fortunately, Nolan returns to the human elements where ""Interstellar"" thrives with McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway. Chastain is awesome. She gives a touching poignancy to bond with Cooper beyond time and space. Hathaway shines, but seems under leveraged. McConaughey is at his best; he is the power within ""Interstellar"". We pull for him for his love for Murph, and he gave his word in a world of no possibility. This is where ""Interstellar"" transcends.",Interstellar
175,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A science fiction masterpiece only Christopher Nolan could deliver.,10/10,8 March 2019,"The first time I saw this film, I was speechless. I knew what to expect from Christopher Nolan, who had been steadily increasing his repertoire for almost two decades. Each of his films outdid the last and built on the already mind-blowing pieces that have gone before them. From The Following (1998) to Memento (2000) to The Prestige (2006) to Inception (2010), I wondered how he could outdo himself with his first foray into hard science fiction. Needless to say, I was impressed by Interstellar (2014) and Nolan's ability to bring the theoretical and incredible ideas of interstellar travel into an entirely plausible setup.As was the case with his previous films, Nolan manages to bring together almost disjointed moments into a cyclical narrative. Much like Memento, I wanted to sit down and watch the whole thing again immediately after viewing it for the first time, so that I could catch all the little things that lead to the major reveal at the end. Even with a running time of almost three hours, I'd gladly sit through two back-to-back viewings to fully embrace the impact of this film. This is the power of storytelling that Nolan has shown over the years and still maintains today, regardless of genre.While some people would fault Interstellar for its loud music, I feel it is the perfect counterpoint to the silence of outer space. The swell of Hans Zimmer's score matches perfectly with the power and emotion brought out through the characters. There's nothing more heart-wrenching than watching a father filter through a lifetime of his children growing up before his eyes in mere minutes. The sheer scale of the film is something I have rarely seen in movies. It makes you truly understand how small we are in the universe. When the credits finally roll, you'll have laughed, you'll have cried (a lot), and you'll finally have a chance to catch your breath.A science fiction masterpiece only Christopher Nolan could deliver, I give Interstellar 5.0 stars out of 5.",Interstellar
176,khanbaliq2,Interstellar is driven by scientific concepts that fascinate and thrill in equal measure.,8/10,12 November 2014,"Interstellar is a film about space travel and the heroism of reaching for something greater. The optimistic and forward-looking themes of this film are something that we haven't seen in American science-fiction movies for a long time. Because of this, Interstellar is definitely closest to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Right Stuff (1983). And like those two masterworks of film-making it's mostly about human nature and going into the unknown. Director Christopher Nolan and his screenwriter brother Jonathan have always tried to bring intelligence to their screenplays. One can find faults with the execution of the ideas in this film but it remains thought-provoking regardless. There isn't much action in Interstellar. Most of the time is spent on showing a nearly inhospitable future world and the mission to explore new worlds. Still, since this is a Nolan film, the action that's included is thrilling and no less awe-inspiring than in his previous films. In fact, the action alone is worth the price of admission. It's that good. I can fault Nolan for spending too much time on Earth because in Interstellar this setting just isn't that interesting. The messages of Environmentalism are also easy to notice. Sure, the time is spent on getting to know Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) family and why he decides to leave. But because this is a science-fiction movie it would have been better to spend more time on what happens in space. Interstellar is a slice of escapism with surprisingly good performances from the actors. Fascinating and thrilling scenes in the film are especially aided by Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy, Wes Bentley and Matt Damon. McConaughey effectively brings Cooper's internal conflict to the surface. He turns the widowed astronaut into a likable protagonist. I'll end my review by mentioning that Interstellar feels like an epic film. When it's over there's a feeling that a lot has happened. This visually dazzling experience takes unexpected turns. I can easily say that it's Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight (2008). Some people may disagree with me on this. I like Inception (2010) too, and I like The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in particular. Interstellar, however, is Nolan's most ambitious film. It's good enough to stand among the most ambitious science-fiction films ever produced. I recommend it.",Interstellar
177,RforFilm,"Interstellar strives to be a human driven tribute on space flight, but lacks the humanity to launch",5/10,8 November 2014,"Like the iconic 2001: A Space Odyssey, the furthest universe is best when it's portrayed as an uncharted ocean; something that's so mysterious that the imagery we see is never still. Dimensional and unexpected are the words that come to me when I try to consider what's out there. While I think that extraterrestrials are possible, I was one to never believe in creatures that would visit us to attack the earth or study humanity. We have evolved to learn more about space and what we have understood is that the Earth is more special then ever; there is only one of us within our galaxy and it's up to us to keep our home habitable.I can understand why people are keen to saving our planet; you destroy our place and you destroy our species. Interstellar really emphasizes how important it is to make sure that humanity will forever have a place, even if Earth cannot forever be it's home. It also pushes how little of the universe we have really tapped. We may have looked through telescopes and developed theories on how everything works, we will never understand until we can continue going up. Interstellar shoots for the stars in the latest Christopher Nolan feature.In the future, humanity it at the brink of collapse as the Earth has been ravaged to a point where weather in cumbersome and farmers are seen as ideal careers. One of them is Cooper (played by Mathew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot who lives in a dusty home along with his father Donald (played by John Lithgow) and his two kids Tom and Murph. Murph convinces her father that a gravitational anomaly is occurring in her room. This leads them to an underground facility where former members of NASA including physicist Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) have been scooping a newly opened wormhole near Saturn.They tell Cooper that a mission is being planned as the last hope for the future of humanity. The goal is to send astronauts through the wormhole to examine the three Earth-like planets that people could settle on. For his skills years before, Cooper is selected to pilot the mission, but this requires him to be away from his family for years (decades!). He makes the promise to come back, but Murph refuses to hear it and only considers that she may never see her father again. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He took something like Batman and has given us The Dark Knight; a movie that changed super hero movies forever. I was hoping that Interstellar would do the same for science fiction. I'm sad to say we do not have the next masterpiece. Interstellar keeps boasting that it's a story about humanity, yet I found very little of it here. McConaughey, Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain all talk more like professors then identifiable beings. Sure they will talk about their emotions related to the story, but they seems to love talking about it's meaning and philosophy more.Speaking of story, it tries hard to emulate 2001 by crafting it's story in separate parts. The first third, set on Earth and going through the wormhole, has it's moments. The second part, all about the various planets and the state of Earth, is overlong and stuffed with relative physics, and comes off more boring. The final act however is so good that I cannot even say why, though it matches 2001's ending. Aside the story's pacing, I can't say it's a total waste as there is a clear mission for our heroes and their goals. Blockbuster seekers will probably get their fill, but they need to pay attention. Though I was disappointed story wise, Interstellar was a nice movie to look at. If Nolan does something in his movies that never go wrong, it's the cinematography. The farming scenes look eerily close to Dorothea Lange 's Dust Bowl shoots, the space scenes are phenomenal (I want that shot of the spaceship flying under the rings of Saturn), and as I said, the third act blew me away for reasons that I cannot spoil. I'll give this five wormholes out of ten. Again, sorry to diss a Christopher Nolan film, but Interstellar is too bound by it's own ambition and science. It gets high marks for is notes, but fails in it's final presentation. I do think that a lot of people will be moved by this, but this makes me move to the theater that's screening Inception or The Dark Knight.",Interstellar
178,Quietb-1,Stellar performances help this space adventure.,7/10,6 November 2014,"Interstellar is a great two hour movie, unfortunately it runs nearly three hours. It suffers the written, directed and produced by curse and just goes on way too long. All the credit and the blame goes to Christopher Nolan.The good performances are highlighted by Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph. Middle Murph, Jessica Chastain, works but Ellen Burstyn in the role of old Murph was braver then the characters going into space. Hard to belief Anne Hathaway as an astronaut. Must have been in the Sandra Bullock class at the Academy.Great visuals, early character development to make you care and an often too rousing score all work. After about two hours in you begin to squirm in your seat. There is some ""mumble jumble"" science fiction dialogue. The Anne Hathaway character goes with her heart to find Dr. Mann, when found there is no indication of any romance past present or future. When Mathew McConaughey wrestles Dr. Mann it is inter-cut with Murph on Earth too many times. The predictable, we know who has been sending Murph the messages scenes drag on way too long.It's a big movie and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The film print presentation gives a look that has been recently lost in the digital cinema. When you exit the theater you are in need of a breath of fresh air and relieved to find the earth as you left it.",Interstellar
179,petra_ste,Do not go gentle into that good night,7/10,5 June 2015,"When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction.The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all.The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar.Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems.See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf.Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter.At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act.When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here.6,5/10",Interstellar
180,Anurag-Shetty,A visually stunning space adventure.,9/10,17 November 2014,"Interstellar is a movie about Cooper(Matthew McConaughey). A few years in the future, Earth is running very low on resources & most of the remaining humans on Earth have become farmers. Cooper is one of them. However, Cooper used to be a NASA pilot. Earth has also become uninhabitable due to the constant dust storms. With the encouragement of his old NASA teacher, Professor Brand(Michael Caine), Cooper agrees to travel through space to find a new habitable planet. When he goes to space, he upsets his daughter Murph(Mackenzie Foy) who feels abandoned. Cooper goes on his space voyage with, Brand(Anne Hathaway), Doyle(Wes Bentley) & Romilly(David Gyasi). Interstellar is a treat for the eyes. The black hole & the various planets & galaxies look magnificent. Christopher Nolan has done it, yet again. Apart from being a visually stunning movie, Nolan has also infused the movie with a lot of emotional scenes. The bond between Cooper & Murph is one of the highlights of the film. The music by Hans Zimmer is captivating. Watch Interstellar only in IMAX, as this is the best format to watch the movie. When the astronauts take the Endurance spaceship to go to space, you can literally feel your seat vibrate. You feel like you are with the astronauts on this fantastical journey. Just when you think there are no major twists in the movie, Nolan surprises you again. The script by Jonathan Nolan & Christopher Nolan is complex, emotionally engaging, filled with twists & wow inducing. The performances are another highlight of the film. Matthew McConaughey is spectacular as Cooper. Anne Hathaway is impressive as Brand. Jessica Chastain is great as Murph. Mackenzie Foy is brilliant as Murph(10 yrs). Wes Bentley is effective as Doyle. David Gyasi is good as Romilly. Casey Affleck is awesome as Tom. Timothy Chalamet is adequate as Tom(15 yrs). John Lithgow is brilliant as Donald. Matt Damon is amazing as Dr. Mann. Topher Grace is impressive as Getty. Bill Irwin & Josh Stewart are great as the voices of robots, TARS & CASE, respectively. Last but not the least, Michael Caine is incredible as Professor Brand. Go watch Interstellar immediately. If you have a choice, watch it in IMAX.",Interstellar
181,bankofmarquis,Thrilling and Original,9/10,24 November 2014,"Movie theaters are constantly trying to figure out how to get butts in their seats. So they've added alcohol, better food, louder sound and luxury reclining seats (the best innovation, IMHO). I have a solution on how to get more butts into theater seats...Make more movies like INTERSTELLAR!Christopher Nolan's space epic was made to be seen on the big screen, with big screen sound and visuals. It tells 2 stories in 1. The first movie is a sci-fi thriller along the lines of CONTACT, GRAVITY and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The 2nd movie is a father/daughter relationship story that brings much needed heart to the spectacle.Matthew McConaughy is well cast in the lead as Astronaut (and father) Cooper. The ""McConnassaince"" continues as he is able to capture and hold the screen against the stunning visuals and sound that is the hallmark of this movie.Director Christopher Nolan continues his penchant for creating real (not green screen) effects and it shows in the visceral nature of the action scenes. The visuals are eye-popping, the sound is appropriately jarring and the effect is stunning - especially a spinning space station rescue scene that is every bit as ""roller coaster exciting"" as was last year's GRAVITY.The father/daughter relationship between McConaughey and Jessica Chastain is grounded and real, reminiscent of the relationship of Jodie Foster and David Morse in CONTACT. Chastain grounds this movie on Earth while McConaughey is driving through space. Her scenes with Michael Caine, Casey Affleck and a surprisingly good Topher Grace make the Earth-bound scenes terrific.But, make no mistake, the thrill of this movie is following Cooper and fellow astronauts Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley and David Gyasli on their quest to the stars to save the planet. Special notice should be made of the vocal work that the always-interesting Bill Irwin does with the robot TARS. He nearly steals this movie from his human co-horts, part HAL, part R2-D2, without being annoying.The first 4/5 of this movie is a somewhat ""realistic"" sci-fi adventure, while the last part is a fantastical ""what if"" through the wormhole, reminiscent of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I've heard complaints of this part of the movie. My argument is this: if you've accepted the premise of the first parts of this movie, then roll with the last part and you'll be entertained, indeed.Just remember, you'll be MORE entertained if you catch this in a movie theatre.9 (out of 10 stars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).",Interstellar
182,bankofmarquis,Another tremendous cinematic experience by the best director of our time,9/10,9 August 2018,"2015's INTERSTELLAR is one of Christopher Nolan's most ambitious works - and that is saying alot. It also is one of his best. Nolan - and his brother, the screenwriter of this film, Jonathan Nolan - wanted to make a ""real"" science fiction film, with the emphasis on the science, so they enlisted the help of noted theoretical physicist, Dr. Kip Thorne to ensure that they were not violating any established physical laws and that all speculations would spring from science and not fantasy.And, for the most part, they succeed.Following the adventures of ""everyman"" Cooper (if you call a farmer who is also a top notch astronaut, pilot and engineer an everyman), Interstellar tells of an Earth of the not-too-distant future that is running out of food and mankind must find a new planet to inhabit or else face extinction. Talked into leaving his family and heading into space, Cooper must face the challenges of his mission while fighting the emotions of leaving his family behind on a dying world.As Cooper, Matthew McConaughey (at the height of his ""McConnaissance"") is perfectly cast as this ""everyman"". He brings the right balance of charisma, heroism, emotional maturity, intelligence and a ""down to earth"" behavior that has us rooting for him from the start. His acting is at the highest level and is matched, beat by beat by Jessica Chastain and (surprisingly to me at the time) Anne Hathaway as a fellow astronaut/scientist.The special effects, worlds, circumstances, narrow escapes and deflating defeats are all handled in typical top-notch Nolan fashion, but it is the emotional stakes - specifically between McConaughey and Chastain (as his grown up daughter) are what keeps this film ""grounded"" and rises it above the standard sci-fi fair.Nolan regular Michael Caine, the always great John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, Ellen Burstyn, a ""before he was famous"" Timothee Chalamet, another ""before he was famous"" David Oyelowo, Casey Affleck and a ""surprise apperance"" by a very famous ""A"" lister (who I will not name, so as not to ruin it) are all equally as good and give the proceedings the gravitas it needs.Special notice needs to be made of the performance of Bill Irwin as the robot TARS (all space movies need a robot, right?). He performs the puppetry of the robot (Nolan wished to do everything as ""practical"" as possible) and adds large doses of humanity - and humor - to this non-human.Another bit of special notice needs to be given to frequent Nolan collaborator - the brilliant Composer Hans Zimmer. He was tasked by Nolan to create a ""unique"" score - one that does not rely heavily on crescendoing strings and horns - and he succeeds tremendously with a hauntingly, melodic and driving score that heightens - but never overpowers - the scenes playing on the screen.The decision as to whether or not you like this film will hinge on your ""believability"" of the final chapter - one where I ""went with the flow"" and was all right with, but (I'm sure) others will struggle with.All in all, another top notch film by the best director of our day. If you have never seen INTERSTELLAR - or if you haven't seen it in awhile - I suggest you check it out, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Interstellar
183,rbrb,"2014's ""Epic"" idea of 2001: A Space Oddity",6/10,18 November 2014,"This movie is around 3 hours long-and it felt like 3 days. And yes it is quite good, but an epic in pretentiousness and political correctness, which assures it of a clutch of awards.The earth is dying, so NASA needs to use a worm hole to find an alternative planet. The hero's are a father and his daughter. In brief the story asks the question will the search for another habitable world be successful or not?The film explores amongst other things that popular sci fi idea of time travel. Unfortunately much of the picture is full of junk science and techno babble. Throw in some strong ideas about ""love"" and family and a famous poem, and that is about it.Good points: special effects, production design, a number of good one liners.Bad points: Far too long, an unnecessary complicated and convoluted story line plus having Michael Caine in the film. He very nearly ruins it as he speaks like a cockney selling fruit in a street market rather than a respected scientist that he is meant to portray.Because of the bad points I need to significantly reduce my vote and hence I give this:6/10.",Interstellar
184,Ruskington,Typically mind-bending and visually breathtaking,9/10,9 December 2020,"An astonishingly ambitious project by Christopher Nolan is executed almost flawlessly. So rare to see this kind of subject matter given so much authenticity. My one gripe is that I found it almost impossible to interpret Matthew McConaughey's southern drawl and eventually had to resort to subtitles (this is NOT a movie that should have be watched with subtitles). Truly staggering production by a man who continues to raise the bar.

186,agmoldham,A film that people are passionate about!,6/10,23 December 2014,"I know there are some films that people get very passionate about. This passion is generally aroused because the movie is of a certain genre that they love or features an actor/director that they admire. There is no doubt that Interstellar is such a movie. It is a sci-fi film directed by Christopher Nolan and as such is a film that many people will have a big emotional investment with. If you read a few of the other reviews you will see this shining through.The film tells the story of earth as it struggles with food shortages. A worm hole is discovered in the solar system which gives mankind a chance to find a new home and source of food. The challenge facing those that leave and Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) in particular is leaving the people they love back on earth. I found the film beautifully shot, but a bit ponderous at times. The cast oozes quality though, so it's never dull. I will watch the film again to see if a second viewing may result in a more passionate response! If you are really into sci-fi movies or Christopher Nolan I am quite sure you will absolutely love the film.",Interstellar
187,Vivekmaru45,"Whenever An Astronaut Goes Into Uncharted Space, He Makes A Great Personal Sacrifice For The Human Race.",7/10,4 June 2015,"This is Nolan's second Sci-fi film (his first was Inception 2010). The film is about traveling through a black hole into another part of the galaxy, light-years away from Earth.Due to deteriorating conditions on Earth which has caused a severe fall in food production worldwide, NASA scientists decide to send a group of astronauts into a wormhole that has opened near Saturn and leads to new planets in another galaxy that may offer hope for humanity's survival. The wormhole is discovered by Dr. John Brand(Sir Michael Caine) who attributes its creation to a superior alien race. The black hole is named Gargantua. NASA sends twelve scientists through the wormhole to identify potentially habitable worlds. Three of the missions are sending back positive signals: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann.Brand recruits Cooper(Matthew McConaughey), former pilot and NASA astronaut, to command and pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the scientists' complete data on the planets, while he continues work on solving the use of gravity for propulsion, to send humanity on space stations to one of the habitable planets. Watch the film to see what happens next.I found the film a very gripping. The tension in the film is passed onto the viewer and we keep on wondering on what will happen next. The cast is decent, the special-effects, sound and cinematography are what we would expect from a Chris Nolan film. The only problem I had about the film, was the ending. The ending seemed to be catered for or tailored for keeping the audience satisfied, rather than to leave a through-provoking after image as Nolan's film Memento left us with.More Sci-flicks to see: 2001 A Space Odyssey, 2010 The Year We Make Contact, Nightflyers, A Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun(a.k.a Doppleganger), The Dark Side Of The Moon, Moontrap, Shadowzone, Pulse 1988, Altered States, Somewhere in Time, Mission To Mars, Red Planet, Event Horizon, The Alien Trilogy, Back To The Future Trilogy, Silent Running, The Black Hole, Brainstorm, Liquid Sky, Wavelength, The Xtro Trilogy, Dune, Iceman 1984, The Philadelphia Experiment, Starman, The Original Startrek Movies 1-6, D.A.R.Y.L., Cocoon Duology, Lifeforce, Explorers, The Quiet Earth, Maximum Overdrive, The Wraith.

189,MihaiSorinToma,Cosmic masterpiece,10/10,5 October 2018,"In a futuristic world where Earth's resources have mostly vanished and people are on the verge of starvation, an ingenious engineer accepts to be sent in a space expedition, hoping to find a new habitable world which to populate. With the promise of return, he's determined to complete his vital mission, but, along the way, he will encounter many obstacles, more and more unexpected and tedious, which will make him question anything he knew about life and time.It's a mind boggling experience which I found simply amazing, no matter the point of view. I was astonished by its complexity and visual effects, let alone its wow inducing facts regarding time and the universe. Its story slowly evolves, going into uncharted territory to my delight, ending after nearly three unnoticed hours with style. Although apparently lengthy, it manages to create a superb cosmic atmosphere, filled with mystery, suspense and tension, boredom being something out of the question.It's simply an astonishing piece of cinematography, thanks to its cast, story and visual effects. The fact that it didn't won much more academy awards simply puzzles me.",Interstellar
190,swilliky,Strange space travel story that has a silly ending but still an interesting Nolan film,6/10,22 July 2017,"Christopher Nolan takes on space travel in a scientific thriller. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a scientist and former pilot haunted by his past accidents. He lives with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and his grandfather Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that a ghost is in her room but Cooper tells her to use the scientific method. Crops are dying and people are assigned to their careers as resources are being consolidated. When Cooper finds a signal coming from Murph's room, Murph deciphers a binary code from the bookshelf. He follows the coordinates to a military base when he learns about a mission to space. The NASA scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway) takes Cooper to a meeting with her father (Michael Caine) and others including a robot.The mission hopes to search for a new habitable world and they invite Cooper to come along with his engineering and piloting skills. Despite a message from the bookshelf to stay, Cooper goes on the mission rocketing into space with Brand, Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi). Their search for habitable planets takes them through a black hole to a solar system with three potential planets. The biggest complication is gravity and relativity cause for a huge time jump that will change every hour into seven years back on Earth. The first planet is a water planet that has giant tidal waves heading towards their spaceship. Doyle is wiped out by the wave but Brand is saved by the robot. They are stuck on the planet for longer than they had hoped because the engines are waterlogged.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Interstellar
191,abisio,A very long piece of crap. Nolan's give us a break please !!!,1/10,1 December 2014,"If you ever saw Kubrick's 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie. If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap.""INTERSTELLAR"" is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement. ""INCEPTION"" was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive.The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed).In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam.",Interstellar
192,bob-the-movie-man,Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark,10/10,12 November 2014,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

193,bryank-04844,"While this film could have benefited from being a tad shorter and tighter, 'Interstellar' still soars high above the rest.",8/10,12 August 2015,"It's obvious with 'Interstellar' that Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is Christopher Nolan's favorite film, which is no secret if you've seen interviews with the 'Dark Knight' director. Armed with a core plot that all life on Earth will one day soon need to find a new planet to live on to survive, 'Interstellar' dares to define a new meaning to the term science-fiction. This visually stunning movie is a gift to watch on the big screen, particularly in IMAX, and tries so hard to deliver on both the science fiction aspects of space as well as our complex human emotions. With a film that has so much going for it in it's near three-hour run time, and so many big set pieces and theories, there are things that are bound to stick the landing, and other things that are destined to fall flat.Where you might 'Interstellar' in the science-fiction category, it doesn't fall into that ""way-out-weird"" sub section, where aliens with acid blood run rampant. Instead, Christopher Nolan and his brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan hired physicist Kip Thorne, who received a hefty executive producer credit for his consulting on all things science and technical on the film. My point is that every bit of space talk and what we would deem science-fiction was completely thought out by actual scientists and physicists to give us the most realistic version of this story. But Nolan tends to center the story on our core human emotions rather than the actual mission at hand, specifically between a father and his daughter. And it's through this plot device that molds this epic and beautiful film for better and worse.In an effort not to go the same route as so many other previous directors have gone, Nolan uses a life threatening infestation that is in the form of many big dust storms that are making planet Earth uninhabitable, rather than the usual climate change or global warming. Cooper (and impressive Matthew McConaughey), a former engineer and pilot, knows that something must be done soon, but has since been forced to become a corn farmer since NASA shut down several years ago, due to the economic climate. Cooper's ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) share her dad's love of space and science, which in a funny scene, gets her suspended for believing the Apollo moon landings from the 60s were real. Seems like people in this film think the Apollo missions were staged and filmed on land in order to bankrupt the Russians, a theory some people still have that Kubrick filmed these staged landings.Cooper and Murph share their farm house with Cooper's teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Donald (John Lithgow), his dead wife's father. Cooper keeps things lively and obvious loves his kids to no end as they constantly talk about space and science and wonder about the stars in the sky. Luckily, NASA isn't really defunct now, but has gone secretly underground - literally, and is led by the intelligent Professor Brand (Michael Caine). He is leading an all out effort to send a spaceship to scout for a new home. The direct path to this mission is to go through a wormhole in space near Saturn that will shoot this brave crew to another galaxy, which NASA is getting signals from previous explorers they sent out years ago.Since Cooper is basically the only person for this job, he takes it, but that means he must leave his two kids, because he doesn't know how long he'll be gone. This doesn't go well, particularly for Murph who Cooper leaves inconsolable and remains an emotional mess for the entire film. This small crew led by Cooper includes Professor Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), a scientist, and amazing astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and a very cool looking robot named TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin).Their trip to Saturn alone wil be two years, but once in another Galaxy, the time is different on Earth where maybe only a few hours to Cooper and his crew would be 23-years on Earth. And now Cooper and his crew must find a suitable planet to continue the human existence. McConaughey does an exceptional job here, pulling at the heart strings several times during the film. He can play the role of the ambitious go-getter and excited kid-like adventurer, and then flip the switch and become a ferocious brilliant leader and then turn it around and sob like a baby when seeing videos of his kids all grown up.Murph, now in her mid-thirties (Jessica Chastain) is good, but her character is one- note and still never gotten over the fact that her dad left her all those years ago. This is a recurring problem through the film. Anne Hathaway's character has a little more wiggle room, but not much and plays an annoying scientist who throws a small fit when she doesn't get her way. David Gyasi is excellent here, but is not given enough screen time to develop, although we all wish he was given the opportunity. But with Murph's older character, she just can't move past her her abandonment issues, therefor the story doesn't progress a whole lot with her, although she is a vital vein to the story.Hans Zimmer's score is monumental and always adds to each piece of emotion and suspense in the film. That being said, there were several moments where the impressive score outweighed some important dialogue, which was a little annoying, but just like Kubrick's '2001' opus, the space shots were silent with an good partnering score. Christopher Nolan has given 'Interstellar' the opportunity to explore the elaborate human emotions in a science-fiction setting, something I hope to see more of.While this film could have benefited from being a tad shorter and tighter, 'Interstellar' still soars high above the rest.",Interstellar

195,Ben_Cheshire,Nolan solves the space epic: breathtaking for three hours!,10/10,12 May 2015,"edit: no idea why this review is so unpopular. I loved Interstellar, I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey, but find 2001 too glacial and was impressed by the amount of pathos Nolan provided in this genre. Yes, HAL is an incredible character, like a spurned lover, but I'm never moved like I was while watching Interstellar.-BenA great director tries his hand at a space epic and the results are remarkable.Thematically, the film is mindblowing; theatrically, the film is mindblowing. There are echoes of Kubrick's 2001, but this time with feeling. There is humour, pathos and incredible scenes of technical wizardry. Special effects sure have come a long way since 2000's The Perfect Storm. The scene featuring the large ""mountains"" was incredible.Incredible performances, characters you care about, a long movie that will grab hold of you through its entire length. Matthew McConaghey is great. He is a far more likable and human figure than Di Caprio was in Inception. I'd rank this up with Memento as Nolan's greatest achievement. Great to see him have the time to solve the space epic.10/10",Interstellar

Well for some parts I did, but for the others I did not. For example, Prometheus was far better film as far as the sci fi genre goes.The plot for this film was somehow same to what I saw before in other types of these films. I could make a puzzle from different plots and make this one. It was all said and done before.Acting did not impress me either, somehow casting could of been better. I do not know, do you agree with this? Visual effects were excellent, but today they all are since the companies which make these types of films really figured out their trade well.If you like sci fi films you should see this film, otherwise do not loose your sleep over it.

197,mikayakatnt,Perfect Sci-Fi Film,10/10,13 January 2020,"Interstellar is how a good sci-fi movie should be.Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's experimental space epic almost half a decade in the making. There was extra work taken to ensure scientific accuracy and artistic quality. All of it pays out at the end of this unforgettable film.Interstellar is a beautiful, slow yet intense move that spans for about three hours. Though it does take time to move the plot, more is done in for the sake of exposition and world(s)-building. The visual effects of this film are astonishing.Also, I applaud Nolan's decision to hire Hans Zimmer on this masterpiece. Without his mesmerizing work, this film would have felt incomplete.Interstellar came out at a time there was waning government interest in space. Funding was cut for NASA and we were unsure if we'd ever launch a space mission again. But with the success of Interstellar among other events, we're back to seeing space exploration in the cultural mainstream. The cultural impact of this movie cannot be forgotten when discussing this film.5/5. Favorited. Stellar (heh) performance by all actors and those who worked on this film.",Interstellar
198,ofpsmith,It's good.,8/10,23 January 2016,"Interstellar get's a lot of praise, but the demographic seems to be split. People either like or dislike it. Personally I like it, but not as other people who like it did. I don't know I just felt as though most of the characters weren't interesting enough and just seemed to be pawns for exposition. The plot is complicated in that Nolan way, but here it is. In the near future, Earth is starting to suffer due to a giant dust bowl. Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine) enlists ex-pilot Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to pilot a mission to find another planet. Unfortunately due to relativity of time, this causes Cooper to be away from his daughter Murphy Cooper (Jessica Chastain) for the majority of her life, even though the mission itself doesn't take that long. The story is very complicated and it can lose you if you're not paying attention, so if you liked Inception, you'll probably find this pretty interesting. The acting is good, but most of the characters, with the exception of Cooper and Murphy aren't very interesting. Actually half the time my favorite characters really end up being the robots which ironically seem more like people, than the actual people. However there is one thing this movie can not be denied. It's epic. It's shown on such a large scale that you have to get invested in what's going on, even if you don't understand it. Not to mention that soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is amazing. I'm actually listening to it as I'm writing this. If you like Nolan you'll probably like Interstellar.",Interstellar
199,jdkraus,Creative. Brilliant. Original. The Best of 2014?,9/10,2 December 2014,"Christopher Nolan's latest film ""Interstellar"" is set in the near future where earth is facing an apocalypse. Blight has wiped out much of the planet's food supply. Dust storms ravage the landscape like the Depression-era's Dust Bowl. The only hope is a new home for humanity. Nolan and his brother John take an interesting structure on how to reveal their story to the audience. We are first introduced to Cooper (Mathew McConaughey), a widowed, former pilot and engineer turned farmer, who takes care of his two children Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and lives with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). He has a knack for chasing down surveillance drones and idealistic thoughts of space travel. He is a character that thinks very much outside of the box in terms of earth's future. Rather than being a ""caretaker"" for earth, he dreams of exploring new horizons. The Nolan brothers give us almost an hour's time to digest and comprehend all the characters. The film itself feels very much like a family drama with a gentle hint of science fiction. We are later introduced to NASA and learn that there is a program, which hopes to achieve planet relocation for humanity. The catch is for Cooper to partake in a journey that involves a wormhole and a severe space time continuum that may result in him not being able to return home, much less save earth in time.The movie shifts gear to space, where three fellow astronauts and a walking, talking computer with sarcastic tendencies accompany Cooper. They explore new worlds, encounter perilous situations, and discover hidden truths that could ultimately determine the fate of humanity's survival. The last twenty-minutes alone is a masterwork that feels like a contemporary version of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" For a first time viewer, the ending maybe a bit confusing or deep. Several people in the theater with me began uttering phrases like ""What did I just watch?"" or ""I don't get it. What happened?"" Like Nolan's ""Inception,"" this is a film that warrants multiple viewings. This reason may not necessarily be for audiences to help understand the events of the plot better, but rather to find concealed levels of sophistication in this multi-layered film. ""Interstellar"" is a movie you can watch once and be entertained. It is also one that can be viewed many times as a method to catch all the little details that Nolan has thrown into his film. Like a good, thought-provoking film, every shot and every bit of dialog is important and has a reason. However, unlike a great intricate movie, there are moments in the plot where elements do not make much sense. Others feel forced and rushed. This may sound odd since it is almost three hours long. There are some moments that deliver as incredibly fast, such as Cooper saying good-bye to his family in one scene and then suddenly appearing in space with three characters that the audience had not been fully introduced. In this way, the movie feels almost like two films in one, the first with his family and the other as an epic space adventure. I can picture what Nolan wanted to achieve with his film—a sci-fi masterpiece with three-dimensional characters and a unique story. Sometimes it takes a long time to tell a story in its, entirety. ""Interstellar"" never feels long. As an audience member, I could care less if this movie was five hours. There were transitions and scenes that needed explaining.The film has many great things going for it. McConaughey turns in a truly believable and outstanding performance as Cooper. We can feel the pain he emanates from missing his family and accept that he is a family man. He moved me in this almost as much as he had in ""Dallas Buyer's Club."" The supporting cast fades in the background compared to McConaughey, but they do all right. Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon are among the A-list actors in this movie. They all fit their parts. The visual effects, cinematography, and production design set a futuristic setting without it looking too much like a traditional sci-fi movie (ex: Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, Blade Runner). Rather the look is kind of gritty and it doesn't feel glossy, sharp, or overly polished. The technical attributes are convincing and look photo-realistic, especially the robot TARS. Never did I feel like I was watching a movie surrounded with green screens. The choice of using some practical effects helps in this regard. The musical composition by Hans Zimmer is hypnotizing. It put me in a trancelike state and mesmerized me beyond words. It's his best work since ""Time"" from ""Inception."" ""Interstellar"" is overall a very good movie, perhaps even a great one. Yet I would not call it the best movie of 2014, nor would I hoist it up in the likes of other science-fiction movies. There is the issue of the sound mixing that is worth addressing. While I could hear the majority of the dialog, the mixer artists put the sound effects at top priority over the dialog in some instances. Though many people complain about this, it is really not a surprising technique that Nolan has chosen for his film. ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" had the SFX and music mixed at a higher level than the dialog. This creates a realistic dynamic range. Just think, when you're flying a spaceship that is crashing and you're trying to yell over the malfunctioning controls and engines, your words would not be heard clearly. It is only bad during one pivotal scene where there is no SFX present. Whether by aesthetic, error, or the director's choice, it is very indiscernible and only frustrates the viewer.This is a movie worth seeing in the theaters and I can picture myself seeing it several times. Buying it on Blu-ray though, that's debatable.",Interstellar
200,Movi3DO,Beautiful and emotionally powerful,9/10,3 June 2021,"Murph, I love you, forever...I have been wanting to rewatch this movie because I think I didn't appreciate it enough the first time.And it was the right decision. One of the most beautiful movies that I have seen. The exploration of space and trip through the wormholes were breathtaking, mysterious yet magnificent.I have to talk about the score, which was incredible. Putting this main theme into any moment and that moment will feel angelic and powerful.The cast was stacked and everyone was great. However, most phenomenal was Matthew McConaughey. He was cool and charismatic at times, and then showed so much emotions as a dad when the moments came.Through all that big physics relativity Einstein stuff laid a beautiful theme of love. Here, love is the only thing that transcends time and space, literally. I cared a lot for the father daughter relationship, as well as the faith that they had in each other. Got my lacrimal gland working a bit there.My only problem with the movie was that some of the plot in between felt a bit long. The movie could have been shorter for sure.Overall, an incredible space-time thriller that is beautiful and emotionally powerful. 9/10.",Interstellar

Over-budgeted and overlong, but still enjoyable; unfortunately, Nolan no longer takes a complex idea and cinematically fleshes it out, he instead takes cheap thrills and attempts flip them into something better—here we have the idiocy of Armageddon trying to be flipped into the brilliance of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Definitely has its moments, but nobody will be begging for it not to end.**½ (out of four)

202,vostf,2001 for Dummies,5/10,29 December 2014,"If Spielberg had wanted to remake 2001 that is the kind of stuff we could have expected. Kubrick was derided as being to coldly cerebral (by the hilarious Pauline Kael) so his opus with Arthur C. Clarke was a powerful - philosophical - ellipse about mankind. Interstellar is a dumbed down version where humans do get to express their feelings and AI have a humour parameter.I liked the futuristic vision of Earth, it was great to see something different, in between post-doomsday and pure phantasmagoria. Now the way to connect a brilliant pilot (simply the best) stuck in the dust to the plan to go interstellar was just a gigantic leap of faith for anyone invoking suspension of disbelief. Not that it stroke me violently as such during the show but you are waiting for the Man to fly to the stars and when you see how they managed to transition to this part you do feel this is cheap.Then Interstellar moves forth with lots of boring exposition about why, when, what if... that is all supposed to give us a scientific and credible background. This is simply not very good. Then we get to watch the movie we came for as they reach for the Stars Gate near Saturn (2001), simply called a worm-hole. Most of what follows suffers from the same sin of too much rational exposition in between irrational action by top skilled characters.In the end you are just a passive viewer not knowing if the whole movie added anything to the genre or just mixed pompous mankind stakes with routine Hollywood melodrama. With Solaris Tarkovski already had his own answer to the lack of human feeling in 2001, which Soderbergh remade. Anything less subtle about human feelings for an astronaut is trash. Nobody goes to watch a movie about The Future of Mankind and Serious Space Exploration while only expecting characters to be as emotionally unstable as in a soap opera.",Interstellar
203,RJBurke1942,Where physics takes a death spiral through a giant narrative blackhole,4/10,5 August 2017,"If you deplore negative reviews of movies featuring your favorite director or actor, read no further. Okay, then ... I like science-fiction stories and movies, provided they both stick to the categorical facts and maxims of physics and quantum mechanics. Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001:A Space Odyssey (1967), in the main, is the quintessential example which sticks to those requirements. But if a story, such as this Interstellar, allows itself to fall into outrageous speculation, then it's not science: it's simple fantasy. Hence, in this movie, fiction is truly stranger than basic truth. Although it does have it's interesting moments....For example, the settings and special effects are simply outstanding; the artwork and CGI are also standout features. The acting, at times, is excellent, especially from McConaughey, Hathaway and Chastain. The supporting cast is generally up to par; and it was a pleasant surprise to briefly see William Devane once again - as an aging nasty, again. The best actors, for my money though, are the robots: TARS and the sort-of-eponymous CASE - both not only highly innovative and imaginative in form and behaviour, but also the best humour in the whole movie (of which there is very little).Regarding the physics aspect, the one thing the writers almost got right (about relativity and time dilation) was a well presented and excellent visual statement when Cooper (McConaughey) finally meets his grown-up daughter, Murph (Chastain). However, the remainder of the dialogue centering upon space travel, worm holes, black holes, gravity, time travel and so on is just full of ... well, holes. And, downright misinformation. Aaah, but it all sounds so cool....While I fully understand why it has a high (but undeserved) score, other inferior movies - The Abyss (1989), Close Encounters (1977), Titanic (1997) - achieve similar levels of approval. Still, this story is well structured without being unduly confusing. Direction, photography and editing are well up to Nolan standard of excellence, as you would expect. The sound track, however, is a tad loud for my liking; and, overall, the pacing is too slow and the overall length too long. Finally, as to the story itself - our dying planet, our need to survive, what can we do? - well, it's topical, important and now, an increasingly urgent issue. But this movie, deliberately or unintentionally, subverts viewers with its blatantly, saccharine banality that: Love conquers all. Meh! To nail things in perspective, this is not nearly as entertaining or imaginative as Inception, even though that one also classed itself wrongly as sci-fi. Overall, Interstellar is a movie only worth seeing if you have around three hours you don't mind using up, for better or worse. Give it four out of ten.

204,DarthVoorhees,Perhaps too ambitious even for Nolan...,8/10,17 April 2015,If rating 'Interstellar' were only about the goals it sets to achieve it would be a Sci-Fi masterpiece taking a place among the best of the genre. Nolan has such lofty and admirable ambitions in what he sets out to do with 'Interstellar'. I admire Nolan a great deal. He takes risks and challenges audiences by mixing big canvas special effects films with deeper ideas. 'Interstellar' is his greatest risk and unfortunately it just can't quite hit the heights of 'The Dark Knight' or 'Inception'. It is Nolan's weakest film by far. The problem lies in the trouble this script has in meshing the characters with the science. 'Interstellar's world is just too large to not have characters our audiences can identify with to keep us grounded.Ironically enough I think 'Interstellar' actually would have worked better as an ambitious HBO style miniseries. I think a major problem with it's script is the time it feels it needs to take to explain the advanced physics behind everything. The script does a very good job in explaining the concepts to a layman but this isn't all that is necessary to do. The Nolan brothers failed to make the ventures into black hole theory feel organic as a part of character and story. This problem with 'Interstellar' is manifested the most in this Coop character who is just too innocent and wholesome. Nolan is trying to do a Spielberg story here and that just isn't where his strengths as a storyteller lie. The character is just too much in command of everything. We are meant to believe that this middle American farmer is intelligent enough to have a grasp on the cold hard science of the film but that he has trouble grasping the fundamental philosophical ethical questions this apocalyptic scenario arises. Coop can't be the computer Nolan has him as and still be the warm empathetic father struggling to save his children. It just doesn't work. It limits what McConaughey can do with the role and it makes Nolan's grand prophetical thesis of the film seem far more overblown and pretentious than it needed to be. I think this problem could have been solved if McConaughey's character had less of that aptitude for science. I think he would have been a stronger character.As a narrative exercise 'Interstellar' has some iffy aspects but as a visual experience it is a masterpiece. Nolan's gift is that his films feel as if they can be touched. He truly has the ability to make one look at the screen in awe. How often can you say that a special effects film truly feels epic today? 'Interstellar' isn't a cartoon. It's grand sweeping views of space with Hans Zimmer's magnificent score in the background shows us a filmmaker who still challenges the confines of the medium without giving in to gratuitous tricks.'Interstellar' is Nolan's weakest film and this is coming from a huge Nolan fan. I will say though that even though it is Nolan's weakest film I still appreciate the risks he takes because they are interesting and bold risks.,Interstellar
205,tomimt,Nolan's ultimate trip.,7/10,9 November 2014,"In the future world is in a brink death. Slowly the arable land is turning into a dust bowl, ridden with plant killing diseases. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot is farming corn, just like everyone else. Peple are too busy to survive and everything else is forgotten. And then Coopers daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) convinces him that a ""ghost"" in her room is real and it is trying to communicate with them. This anomaly leads Cooper to a NASA project, which is aiming to explorer an another galaxy, which can be accessed via a wormhole.In Interstellar Christopher Nolan tries, and at times succeeds, to take notes from Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey. Where Kubrick looked at themes of evolution of mankind, Nolan is trying to aim his scope on the survival of the species, and in some points the possible evolution as well. Though Interstellar is, albeit scientifically a bit top heavy, much easier movie to approach, as it has stronger human element in it than 2001 has.I'm not proclaiming Interstellar to be a similar classic as Kubrick's masterpiece is. At times it comes close, but most of the time it resembles more of the sequel of 2001, 2010, which isn't a bad movie either, just not as strong as its predecessor. Interstellar is better movie than 2010 is though.Nolan is handling grand themes in his movie. Grander and more abstract than he ever has. The themes themselves are at places so big, that they swallow the actors, making them to be just backdrops to the next of those concepts. But will this be the next ultimate trip only time will tell.",Interstellar
206,ersinkdotcom,A lofty and complex commercial which urges us to look beyond our own world,9/10,12 November 2014,"Not many directors these days have the lofty ambitions Christopher Nolan possesses. He goes against the grain of Hollywood more so than any other modern filmmaker. Even his ""Dark Knight"" Trilogy wasn't as conventional as many would think a super hero movie would be. His latest endeavor, ""Interstellar,"" pushes Nolan even further into the realm of exceptional and atypical storytelling.In the near future, Earth is plagued by a blight that is quickly wiping out all the natural resources left on the planet. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test-pilot and Engineer who took up farming when the world gave up on space exploration. After stumbling on to a secret base, he discovers that the supposedly dismantled space administration has been secretly looking for ways to re-establish humanity on another planet and save it from extinction. Cooper finds himself leading a crew of explorers on a perilous exploration beyond our galaxy for a world we can colonize and begin again on.The best way to describe ""Interstellar"" is as Christopher Nolan's version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the ADHD generation. Unlike Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 classic, there's a whole lot more talking and human interaction. The action and drama moves at a quicker pace as well. The Nolan Brothers wrote the script and knew that a movie without dialogue that crawled along to its dramatic and existential climax wouldn't work for today's fast food multiplex audience.I applaud Nolan for his use of models and other practical effects versus today's CGI shortcuts. It gives ""Interstellar"" an authentic look lacking in other science fiction and fantasy films today. The use of actual sets, locations, and props keeps the audience immersed in the movie and not constantly anticipating the next overly-synthetic orc or dragon walking into the scene and pulling you out of the cinematic experience.One thing that makes me laugh about ""Interstellar"" is the way the characters refer to the intergalactic entity contacting humanity as ""they."" Not for one moment do the scientists and explorers take into account that it could be God. After all, the idea of God sending us messages and leading us anywhere is so much more ridiculous than aliens from another galaxy.""Interstellar"" is rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language. Profanity goes beyond the usual expletives and includes the ""ultimate"" bad word at one point. The movie gets stressful at points and could give younger (and even older) viewers bouts of anxiety. Some might also feel a sense of claustrophobia in certain instances.Although ""Interstellar"" definitely contains some of the very same concepts and encourages humankind's exploration of space just like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" that's where the comparisons end. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's story is much more rooted in our sense of preservation than Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's complicated and inexplicable masterpiece. It's a lofty and complex commercial which urges us to look beyond our own world and regain the sense of wonder and curiosity we used to have when it came to the Universe that infinitely surrounds us.",Interstellar
207,Likes_Ninjas90,Nolan is intelligent and will recover but might benefit from making smaller films which can still support some of his bigger ideas.,4/10,4 November 2014,"Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless. But these are studio films, without insight into the filmmaker himself like transparent ideological goals. In interviews, Nolan mirrors this impersonal nature. He is softly spoken, measured and serious, concurrent with the thematic goals of his films like the hidden identities of men. In 2010 The Guardian asked if Nolan is the new Stanley Kubrick, a misguided comparison with superficial parallels. Kubrick distanced himself from Hollywood by owning his own cameras and editing equipment. He also relied on the specificity of images to create meaning rather than dialogue, making his films cinematic in form, not merely scope. Stylistically Terrence Malick (The Tree of Life) is a more appropriate companion to Kubrick. Artistically, Nolan shares more in common with Steven Spielberg as both directors inject ideas into the existing framework of sizable studio films. Spielberg was originally hired to direct Interstellar with Nolan's brother Jonathan writing the script from an idea by physicist Kip Thorne. Christopher Nolan replaced Spielberg and helped rewrite his brother's script. The first hour of Jonathan's original script was set on Earth and retained but his brother's decision to refine the space elements has drawn comparisons to Kubrick's flawed masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey and Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.To this point, I have enjoyed many of Nolan's films but Interstellar's script is terribly inconsistent. Using a mostly narrow, linear structure, the narrative hurls ideas at us about climate change, parenting, space exploration, time travel and alternate dimensions, but the script lacks refinement. The Nolans talk over us, not to us. In a self-conscious move to intellectualise a ""save the world"" story, they substitute detailed characterisation and backstory in favour of impenetrable scientific discussions about relativity and gravity. An embarrassingly rich cast is left to substantiate these thinly realised characters. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a former pilot who is now a widowed farmer with two young children, including a girl named Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and an ageing father-in-law (John Lithgow). Cooper, not dissimilar to Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, is an archetype of the reckless parent who is sentimentally motivated by his children and largely only interesting because of McConaughey's predictable charisma. Earth is doomed because of dust storm and droughts, a nod to The Grapes of Wrath, leading Cooper to be tasked by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) with travelling into space and investigating three potentially inhabitable planets. Another major character is Brand's astronaut daughter Amelia (surely named after Amelia Earhart), played by Anne Hathaway. Her reliable expressiveness instills some surface emotions to an otherwise stony character, with no backstory or arc. Other actors are either underused or have distracting cameos. An actress the quality of Jessica Chastain deserved a bigger part but only features deep into the story in a forgettable role as the adult Murph.This time the self-seriousness which gave the Batman films a unique stylistic tone is Nolan's Achilles' heel. While desperate for the story to emotionally resonate, resorting to extended close-ups of Cooper crying for leaving his children behind, he remains unaware of the story's absurdity. It is an insurmountable task when the dialogue is dry, textbook theory and the plotting becomes increasingly ridiculous, attempting to marry between the spaces of a bookcase shelf the pretensions of alternate dimensions with a family melodrama. There are also episodes where the stock characters fail to move us. During the exploration of the first planet a side character is killed, which expectedly strikes a chord with Cooper and Amelia, but matters little to us when we've barely come to know the character's name. Other singular moments remind us of how skillful Nolan is with set pieces. The first entry into outer space is intensely realised, with the galaxy being simultaneously beautiful and dangerous. The infrequency of these emotions stresses how undisciplined the narrative is, particularly in an incoherent, final hour, which doesn't utilise the multilayered structure of The Dark Knight Rises or strike Inception's emotional high notes.Watching the film in the IMAX format is as inconsistent as the narrative. Hoyte van Hoytema, the usually reliable Dutch-Swedish photographer who shot Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Her and Let the Right One In with great symmetry, has replaced Nolan's regular photographer Wally Pfister. Surprisingly, the early scenes on Cooper's farmhouse are poorly lit and the images are muddy and graining, a deliberate imitation of the sandstorms, but an ugly choice all the same. Other shots use the full volume of the IMAX screen and the scale is impressive. Some of the galactic images are awe-inspiring and vivid but their scarcity coupled with the tight, obstructed camera-work inside the spacecraft, is disappointing. Uncharacteristically, Nolan's pacing is also laborious, dragging the film to his longest running time of nearly three hours. The film isn't as calculated as 2001, a difficult feat for any director, but pales substantially to last year's terrific Alfonso Cuaron film Gravity, which eclipses Interstellar for precision. It was made for sixty-five million dollars less. It is half the length and aside from being a technically superior film, it understands the futility of a large canvas unless our emotional investment is supported by strong characters.",Interstellar
208,lark40,time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece,10/10,13 November 2014,"chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

209,Dan1863Sickles,The Roar of Classic Science Fiction Reduced to A Dull Whine,3/10,5 March 2018,"INTERSTELLAR is a movie I had to watch over and over because I'm a substitute teacher, and whenever this certain science teacher is absent he makes me show it to his slower classes. That's a bad sign, don't you think?This movie is so boring compared to the classic science fiction movies I grew up with, like THE OMEGA MAN starring Charlton Heston. And yet it's funny, because the opening situation is much the same. It's a post-catastrophe environment, where technology has failed and mankind has gone back to a more primitive, tribal way of living. Only there's this one scientist who still believes in science and thinks he can bring mankind back from the brink with technology and courage. And when the society that's left finds out about his attitude it's big trouble!Well, that's where the comparison falls apart. In THE OMEGA MAN the last surviving scientist is a bad ass, with an arsenal of weapons, an awesome bachelor pad, a fleet of sharp sports cars, and a cocky, man about town attitude somewhere between Joe Namath and Hugh Hefner. Each day he fights a one man war against hundreds of mad mutants who want him dead!In INTERSTELLAR the last surviving scientist is a boring shlub who mopes around on a small farm worrying about next year's wheat crop or something. Each day he fights a one man war against a couple of narrow-minded teachers who want him to admit the NASA moon landings were fake. In THE OMEGA MAN the stakes are high. Neville and his sworn enemy Matthias are playing for keeps. Every night. Gun battles, ambushes, people getting burned at the stake. In INTERSTELLAR the stakes are pitiful. Kids flunking at school, drones crashing in cornfields, the high school principal vaguely hinting that the hero's lifeless son ""might be happier as a farmer."" Oh no! And as I said, the flaky thing is, both movies basically explore the same conflict between the scientist's need to know and society's need to keep from knowing. But one movie is full of explosive action, and high drama, while the other one is full of cheap sentiment and melodrama. The contrast between INTERSTELLAR and THE OMEGA MAN reminds me of Mary McCarthy's famous remark about Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN, and in particular the climactic ""attention must be paid"" speech. Mary McCarthy said that it was ""the roar of the old Left theater, reduced to a dull whine.""INTERSTELLAR is the roar of Seventies science fiction reduced to a dull whine.",Interstellar

211,virek213,A Voyage Like None Other Seen In 2014,10/10,10 November 2014,"Given how much Hollywood has been obsessed with mega-budget blockbusters based on comic books or franchise films in the 21st century, it is sometimes easy to forget that certain films of other genres, made on roughly the same budgets can have an impact as well. British director Christopher Nolan's immense and philosophical 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR is just one such film. It is a film that, much like 1997's CONTACT and 2013's GRAVITY, owes a significant story debt to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, a debt that Nolan himself freely acknowledges Set in some unknown, far-flung future in which life on Earth is becoming increasingly uninhabitable due to out of control climate chaos, and where massive dust storms are commonplace, the film stars Matthew McConaughey as the chosen leader of an expedition to find new habitats for what's left of Earth's population in the vast reaches of outer space. But to do that, they will have to venture through a black hole that opened up within our own Solar System, around Saturn. They make that ultra-hazardous journey through the black hole, and find three worlds spinning along the vortex, one of which may very well support human life, and another one of which they find a survivor (Matt Damon) of a previous expedition. They are then confronted with the issues of the space-time continuum that was part of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity; and McConaughey is confronted with having left his family behind to face the apocalyptic devastation that he knows awaits him if and when he should return from the far-flung reaches of the universe. But following another trip through the black hole, McConaughey is in for an extremely big surprise, one as much inspired by The Twilight Zone as anything else.Nolan, whose credits include such comic-book smashes as THE DARK KNIGHT and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, as well as psychological thrillers like MEMENTO and INCEPTION, set himself an enormous task in making INTERSTELLAR. In a movie business so overrun with mega-budget movies with lots of CGI special effects, plenty of explosions, over-the-top stunts, and way over-the-top violence, all of which are supposedly ""sure things"", he took an extreme risk by expending close to $150 million on a fantastic sci-fi opus that touches on genuine human, psychological, and philosophical concerns for the future of mankind. But as Kubrick, one of Nolan's favorite filmmakers, once observed, nothing is as dangerous as a ""sure thing""; and in making INTERSTELLAR the way he has, along with co-writing the screenplay and largely eschewing CGI for more traditional special effects work, some of which had been seen in CONTACT, he has sought to make his concerns every bit as real as humanly possible, and attempted, more than a little successfully, to follow in the footsteps of ""2001"" in showing us the possibilities of where Man was going in the universe, and his ultimate place in the cosmos. He has managed to do this in a film that runs slightly under three hours, or about thirty-five minutes longer than even the lengthy and stately Kubrick masterpiece. This will invariably try a lot of audience members' patience, but the truth is that not every film needs to be reduced to childish lowest common denominator simplicity to be very good.Even with so visual a story that INTERSTELLAR has, Nolan hasn't forgotten that people power films as much as the technicians; and having seasoned actors like McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, and Anne Hathaway, and veterans like Michael Caine and John Lithgow, in the cast is certainly something to be proud of. The scenes of the dust storms ravaging McConaughey's home farm in the opening section of the film are frighteningly impressive; and the passage that McConaughey's ship ""Endurance ""takes through the black hole have some of the mythical quality of the Star Gate in ""2001"", and similar ones in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE and CONTACT.The keyboards/synthesizers/organ score by Hans Zimmer, who is one of the most prominent composers in film music in Hollywood during the 21st century, does a lot to enhance the immensity and the scope of INTERSTELLAR, as Steven Price's did for GRAVITY. And while it is easy to get wrapped up in the IMAX sound and the visuals of the piece, in the end the overwhelming sense to be gotten out of INTERSTELLAR is, like Kubrick and ""2001"", a genuine concern for not only film as Art, but the future of Man in the cosmos. That by itself sets it apart from a lot of Hollywood films of the 21st century.And in the final analysis, all of those things make INTERSTELLAR easily one of the best films of 2014.",Interstellar
212,timdalton007,Going Interstellar,10/10,6 May 2015,"I must confess that I've been interested in Interstellar for awhile now. Then again, I've been interested in space exploration since childhood, a side-effect I suspect of growing up near NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center where the Saturn V rockets of the Apollo era were designed. Also being something of a fan of Nolan's previous films, the idea of him doing a space film was something that seemed irresistible. Indeed, Interstellar is a film not only didn't disappoint but improves with each new viewing with the result being that it could well be the best science fiction film in recent memory.Those familiar with Nolan's work may be surprised that the man who brought us perhaps cinema's most successful take on Batman and films like Inception would be interested in taking us out into the realms of interstellar space. Yet the film contains many of the hallmarks of Nolan's films that make it something that only he could make. It certainly has the epic scale we've come to expect from Nolan's recent films as it takes the viewer from agrarian future Earth, the spacecraft Endurance and distant planets in another galaxy as well as showing Nolan's ability to take often difficult ideas and ground them in a reality viewers can understand.Nolan, speaking in the 2011 documentary These Amazing Shadows, talked about liking films that make the audience come back again and again for which he specifically cited Kubrick's 2001. Interstellar most certainly falls into that category, partly because Nolan makes use of one of his favorite storytelling techniques: non-linear storytelling. Nolan grounds the film within the theory of relativity and its implications, something that becomes increasingly important as the film progresses. That non-linear storytelling also becomes a strong emotional force late in the film as we see father and daughter, one in space and one on Earth, struggling to overcome difficulties as each tries to carry out their end of the plan to save humanity. Yet where that non-linear plotting comes to the fore with the films ending which, I must confess, initially left me wondering if Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat had taken a pass at the script. All of which invites viewers to come back to it again and again in search of answers.Those willing to return to it will find much to appreciate about it. There's the performances for example. Nolan films tend to be well cast affairs anyways but with a cast including Matthew McConaughey, Nolan stalwart Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain in major roles with Mackenzie Foy, John Lithgow, and Ellen Burstyn in supporting roles, it's hard to find a single role miscast here or to imagine anyone else in those parts. McConaughey's performance especially is powerful with it being more than equal to his Oscar winning performance in 2013's Dallas Buyers Club. Mention must also be made of the trio of actresses playing Murph, especially Foy and Chastain, as they become the film's emotional anchor to the Earth once Cooper launches out into space.Production wise as well, there's plenty to be impressed by. The film's five Oscar nominations were for production values and it isn't hard to see why. There's the Oscar winning special effects that, thanks to the input of science consultant Kip Thorne, present us with an as-accurate-as-possible journey through a wormhole as well as distant planets and a trip to that strangest of all phenomenon: a black hole. There's some fantastic production design work covering a wide range of sets and locations which presents us with the most credible depiction of a near-future you're likely to see anytime soon.The icing on the cake though might well be the score from Hans Zimmer, which is the exact opposite of what one has come to expect from him. This score sees him taking a minimalist approach more comparable with Phillip Glass' work on the documentaries of Errol Morris than say Man Of Steel. Yet Zimmer's score also can build to incredible moments of raw musical power as demonstrated by the scene where Cooper leaves home, the music during the sequence on Miller's planet and the sequence that closes the film. That the score didn't win an Oscar is one of the biggest upsets in recent memory.Yet what makes this stand out from something like 2001 is its script. 2001, despite some of its big ideas and visuals, is at times a cold and clinical film where the most human character is the HAL 9000 computer. Interstellar definitely has its share of striking visuals and fascinating scientific concepts but that's not really what the film is about at an emotional level. The film explores humanity's place not just on this pale blue dot but out in the universe from our potential as a species to that fight or flight reflex that leads some of us to do incredible things and others to commit terrible acts of cowardice Interstellar speaks to what drives us and asks what we are capable of, telling us that, in the words of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas that becomes almost a refrain throughout the film, we should not go gentle into that good night and rage, rage against the dying of the light.For me, Interstellar is Nolan's best film yet. It's a remarkable piece of film-making filled with strong performances, incredible visuals and a stunning score. Those things though are all just part of what makes the film as good as it is. Unlike so much out there today, the ultimate message of the film is one of hope. It's a stirring and inspiring tale, told in a science fiction context that brings to my mind what the late Carl Sagan, speaking thirty-five years ago in Cosmos, said: ""The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to stars."" Interstellar shows that we can and that we might just do it too.",Interstellar
213,griffolyon12,"Movie Review: ""Interstellar""",5/10,7 November 2014,"Director Christopher Nolan's new film, Interstellar, examines the macro-size of the universe by observing the micro. Having more in common with works like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Tree of Life than the works of Steven Spielberg, or even Nolan's previous films, Interstellar is a film that takes you on an interdimensional journey across the stars.Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, an ex-pilot/engineer, who is now reduced to being a farmer on a not too distant future Earth, that is slowly dying. Basically think of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression times ten and you get the idea of Earth at the start of Interstellar. However, while the film is about the dire straits Earth is in at the start of this movie, we never see the global impact of this almost apocalypse. Told entirely from the point-of-view of Cooper and his family, in particular his relationship between his 10-year-old daughter Murph (played exceptionally by Mackenzie Foy), the film relays the larger story of what's happening on Earth through the microscopic lens observing this one family struggling to survive. When Cooper is eventually recruited by NASA to pilot a last ditch effort to find a new habitable planet out in space by traveling through a wormhole by Saturn, Interstellar maintains its macro through micro approach by keeping the story firmly engrained within Cooper and his relationships, and that is where the bulk of this movie transpires, in deep space with five astronauts and two robots.Interstellar plays a lot with the theory of relativity, so it should be no surprise that there is a little bit of time manipulation that goes on in this story with Murph aging on Earth, while Cooper stays the same age. This is probably the most unique aspect of the movie, and it lends itself to some of the more emotional moments of the film when Cooper gets video messages from his adult children who are filled with a lot of resentment at his having left them to more than likely never return. It is these emotional aspects of the film that keep Interstellar from feeling too much like a physics class and being human. As a matter of fact, while this film deals heavily with exploring the cosmos, it's pretty clear that the film is more about exploring ourselves than it is in what lies all around us.The two human concepts of love and truth are probably the most prevalent themes in a film that has a great many themes that it is juggling at all times. Even when you get lost in all of the science mumbo jumbo, that often goes beyond simple theorizing to just pure science fiction itself, it is these themes that keep you watching, even if it feels a little like a chore. The biggest thing with Interstellar is just that it's so darn serious. There is very little levity, and not a whole lot of fun going on, which makes it more of a $200 million art film than a blockbuster. I don't know what the box office prospects for this film will be, but I can say that most average moviegoers should probably just skip this one, because this is a long movie that favors talking over action (though the few action scenes we do get are some of Nolan's more thrilling). If you are a moviegoer that loves films like 2001, or the work of Terrence Malick, where you have to think about what's transpiring on screen, then you will more than likely love Interstellar. I am in a camp somewhere in the middle. As a fellow filmmaker, I can appreciate everything here that Christopher Nolan has done with Interstellar, but I really have no desire to see this one again, because it just doesn't do for me what I tend to want out of the movies I see, which is allow me to escape from my reality and have fun for a few hours. This is a movie that is constantly reminding us of our reality, and you couple that with the beautiful, but overbearing organ music from Hans Zimmer, and you can very easily get antsy and nervous before all is said and done, and not in a good way, but in an oppressive one. So it's safe to say this is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, in all actuality it's probably my least favorite of his films, but with that said, this very well may be his most ambitious and thought-provoking film he's ever done. As far as my recommendation goes, go see Interstellar if you love your sci-fi as realistic and thoughtful as possible.",Interstellar
214,mahmus,"Nolan, just shut up for a second.",5/10,9 July 2019,"I'm not gonna say that this is a bad movie, because one, I value the safety of me and my family; and two, I really don't think it is a bad movie, I just don't think it is the masterpiece that so many people say it is.The visuals are great and I'm sure the science is very accurate and that's very impressive......but I never enjoyed the characters.I never liked how Cooper completely ignores his son Tom, who he clearly loves less than Murph.I never liked writing.I've always had a problem with how Nolan movies are written.
Full of endless exposition and corny speeches that are meant to be deep, and this is no differenceThe following is and actual conversatiom from the movie:-------------------------------------------------------------
COOPER: All of this, is one little girl's bedroom, every moment! It's infinitely complex! They have access, to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything! They can't find a specific place in time, they can't communicate. That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph, just like I found this moment.TARS: How, Cooper?COOPER: Love, TARS, love.
-------------------------------------------------------------I don't know. I wanna love this movie, but I just can't.It is technically impressive, but I have no desire to watch it again.",Interstellar
215,nathanmanson,"Amazing, but oh boy it is complicated",8/10,7 May 2020,"Genuinely incredible film but it's a proper thinker so you have to be completely locked in from the first minute of the film to the last. The CGI was really impressive in this. I'm not normally a fan of matthew mcconaughey but he was incredible in this and it's completely changed my view of him.

So do I, but I don't purport to be a space hero.Grizzled, cantankerous old farm boy is apparently the only person suitable to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in order to save mankind, but the twist is that he doesn't know it's a suicide mission. In the end, he makes it back anyway through extended, overwrought, Matrix-style jiggerypokery.2001, Event Horizon, Gravity, Contact, any space film you can think of has been recycled and regurgitated to bring Interstellar to your screen.

218,RossRivero99,Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight and Inception,10/10,25 May 2015,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is by far 2014's best science fiction as well as being one of the best science fiction movies of all time along with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), Star Wars (1977) (along with The empire strikes back (1980)), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script (co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the crew members on the mission. The final scene in this movie was complicated but harrowing at the same time where Murph (this time played by the legendary Ellen Burstyn) is in the hospital when Cooper is 124 years old but is still young. This is one of 2014's very best films.",Interstellar
219,MrDHWong,Spellbinding,10/10,5 November 2015,"Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen.",Interstellar

222,Laakbaar,"Rich, satisfying and gripping epic",8/10,8 November 2014,"This is a rich, satisfying and gripping epic with several interwoven themes: father-daughter relationships, ecological collapse, survival, interstellar travel, alien worlds and more. The space scenes are beautiful, especially the worm hole, black hole and alien worlds.Matthew McConaughey is the emotional heart of the film, and he pulls it off beautifully (like the fine actor we all now know he is). I was deeply moved by a few of the father-daughter scenes. Anne Hathaway and the others were also good.OK, there were several aspects of the movie that did not feel quite right to me. They were jarring, and caused me to question what I was watching. Moreover, I can't say I liked the far-fetched deus-ex-machina ending. But, hey, what do I know about worm holes, event horizons, the fifth dimension and tesseracts. At times, this movie did feel somewhat like other space movies that have been made over the years. Having said this, these problems didn't ruin the movie for me, which I think is worth about 8.5 out of 10. The movie is almost three hours long, but it didn't feel tedious.",Interstellar
223,cliftonofun,Really long...and really good,8/10,26 December 2017,"This film was silly, long, overwrought and pretty far-fetched. But Nolan keeps you in it, emotionally and intellectually. He's a master storyteller even when the story itself fails at points. I could have done without the last 1/3, but the first 2/3 left me intrigued and breathless...just like he likes it. At one point a character demonstrates the time space dimension with a folded piece of paper; Nolan's films are just that: pages of a story folded over and over. You will love the characters, the pathos and the journey even when the point feels a bit - well - pointless. Plus, hard to fault a Science Fiction film for going all religious/philosophical. It's happened before and will happen again.

224,asda-man,Best sci-fi ever?,10/10,18 November 2014,"children I shall be talking about Interstellar. But before I do, I think I better give you a little context, just to show how high my expectations were for this film. I love Christopher Nolan. I am a Nolanite, or Nolanoid, or whatever people who like Christopher Nolan are called. I've pretty much loved every film he's ever done. It confuses me when people slag him off because he's clearly the best writer/director to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since Steven Spielberg, only I think that his films are much better than Steven's.His films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters. As soon as I heard Christopher Nolan's next film was a sci-fi film called, Interstellar, I was excited. I was so excited that I only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer. It was enough, I was sold and I didn't want to see any other trailer, because I wanted to know and see as little as possible.I decided that Interstellar needed to be seen in IMAX, so I booked my ticket to see Interstellar on the biggest screen in the UK. Even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews (I was hoping for full-on rave ones, like when The Dark Knight and Inception came out) I still put my trust into Christopher to deliver me something extraordinary. I don't know if it's the gigantic screen talking, but Interstellar absolutely delivered.This was the best experience I've ever had at the cinema. The huge screen and ear-popping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it, I felt like I had been for a little trip out in space. I'm not sure if this will translate quite so well on your TV screen at home, however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on. Whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heart-stopping set-pieces, at its heart it's an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe.I was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started. The stuff before Matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film. We learn so much about Coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into (three hours which fly by, I might add). There's a strong focus on the relationship between Coop and his daughter, and it's this relationship which drives the film right up to, and including, its jaw-dropping conclusion. The first hour is also quite funny too, which was a nice surprise as Nolan doesn't normally dabble in too much humour.There's a really emotional scene where Coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter, who he doesn't know when he's going to see again, before his space travels. It's beautifully acted by both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film. After this the film adopts an entirely new setting. Literally. We're blasted off into space and the fun really begins. The less you know about the space scenes, the better, as it's a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going! Suffice to say that Interstellar is jam-packed with eye-popping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last year's Gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison.With The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and Interstellar is his biggest yet. He has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it, we should be nurturing it! Interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water. The action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. It's a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished. He's left the big drums and strings behind and re-invented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film.A lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of Interstellar. I can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand. It's complex, but it's still easy enough to follow. However, Christopher completely rips up the rule book and Interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes. Personally, I loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which Christopher Nolan has going inside his head. I found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level. I don't understand it all, but I have my theories and I'm sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb.Interstellar is a truly remarkable experience. It boasts awesome ideas and visuals, but it never forgets its heart. I'm a tough cookie to make cry, but I'm not going to lie (ooh poetry!) there were three occasions when I had tears filling up in my eyes. There are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why I go to the cinema. I don't just want crazy visuals and excitement, I want to be moved and I want to be invested in characters so that I care what happens to them at the end. Interstellar more than achieves that.I'll need to give it another watch to work out where I'd put it on Christopher Nolan's mesmerising filmography, but he hasn't let me down. I hope that Interstellar is seen as a sci-fi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade.Read more weird, dazzling and uncut reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",Interstellar
225,ronakkotian,A visual spectacle that is Nolan's most emotional,8/10,17 March 2021,"Interstellar is set in the future where crop blights and dust storms threaten human survival and so a group of explorers travel through a newly discovered wormhole to find a suitable planet to sustain human life.It amazes me how Christopher Nolan manages to come up with ideas like this. I admire how ambitious he is with his projects and Interstellar may be his most ambitious project to date. Despite its very long runtime, Interstellar never drags and that's because of the astounding visuals and emotion he put into this story. This is, without a doubt, one of his best looking films. There are just some films that are meant to be watched on a large screen with speakers to gain the full experience and Interstellar is one of those films. I honestly couldn't tell which scenes had visual effects and which had practical effects. They both blend so well and seamlessly to create some insane and phenomenal visuals that I think will age extremely well. The cinematography is amazing and you really get a sense that what you're watching is an epic. The sound is equally fantastic and Hans Zimmer's score as usual is incredible. It's a much more eerie score than what I'm used to hearing from Hans Zimmer but I liked it and though it fit well with the scale and stakes of the story.I've always been a fan of Matthew McConaughey I really loved his work here. His entire character has a very emotional arc and I felt the relationship he had with his daughter. A particular scene where we see McConaughey break down is easily one of Nolan's most emotional moments that is sure to leave people crying. For a child performance, I thought Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain did a great job playing his daughter. Anne Hathaway was also really good as well as Michael Caine. There was an actor who I didn't expect to see but was pleasantly surprised when he turned up. I do wish there was more to Casey Affleck and Timothée Chalamet. They both play the son of McConaughey but there was barely any development done to that character for me to care about him.Whilst Interstellar is a visual spectacle and portrays a heartfelt and emotional relationship really well, it's certainly not a perfect film. The dialogue isn't anything special and at times very cheesy especially with one monologue delivered by Hathaway. I'm also not completely sold on the ending. For this story and how high the stakes were, I felt the film wrapped up way too nicely.Despite my issues with Interstellar, I still think it's a solid and emotional film with terrific performances from everyone, some interesting concepts that I'll be pondering over and breathtaking visuals that will stand the test of time.",Interstellar
226,braddugg,Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director.,4/10,8 September 2015,"Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director.Christopher Nolan, is a director of great potential. His body of work speaks volumes of what he has done and what he has capable of. After all he is also a human being, and I suppose he has forgotten that humans have limitations. This film is illustrious of the limitation, which is that the director does not have an audience that thoroughly understands quantum physics.I am a big lover of physics and was a faculty of the same for 4 years of my life. Yet, the dialogs were incomprehensible by me. I must admit my in-competencies here as quantum physics, time travel are something not in my sphere of thorough understanding. Yet, I must also admit that this is the first Nolan film, I felt bored. I dozed off briefly after 20 minutes in the film and it never ever happened in a Nolan film for me. Now, there are few comparisons I would like to draw with an earlier film of Nolan, that is INCEPTION. If Inception, was also equally incomprehensible in the first go, it made me rush to the theater to decipher what it was all about. While INTERSTELLAR is also incomprehensible in the first viewing, it lacked the drive to push me to see it once again. Indeed, I felt exhausted after a near 170 minutes. The performances were superb and Matthew McConaughey has given a terrific performance. He is more a father than an astronomer. Others were all appreciable too. The technicalities were brilliant but those were all on the expected lines, considering the scale of the film. What I am only disappointed is, the screenplay lacked Nolan's magic. Yet, there are moment of awe and the climax, indeed the final shot was surely my pick as it triggers some thoughts in the brain.As per me, this is a lackluster film form a genius of a director. More than anything else, I am just disappointed.If you want to watch a great sci-fi film, there are many ranging from the 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY to the most recent GRAVITY. If you see this and feel this is great then I would congratulate your feeling. For me this is an exhausting lesson in quantum physics.Also, a word about the IMAX where I saw this. The IMAX in Hong Kong is way below the quality I admired in Hyderabad, India. The screen seems much smaller, the audio is not up to the quality, the acoustics are not updated as per technology. I miss the IMAX at Hyderabad in these aspects.A 2/5 for this film, For sure, you may neither love it, nor hate it but surely you cannot ignore it.",Interstellar
227,billygoat1071,Wow,7/10,9 November 2014,"The best way to describe Interstellar is ""Wow."" Aesthetically though. This might be one of Hollywood's milestones of transcending their technical abilities. Those parts of traveling through time and space are totally magnificent, a journey that would blow people away on how a movie could depict such scenario of space odyssey, since of course, 2001. How I explain this may sound too hyperbolic, but really it is a pretty breathtaking ride that the audience may forget its heavy flaws. But sometimes that cannot be possible, the film begs its audience to join with its own philosophy as well, and once it goes deeper to that subject, things somehow become complicated. As a visual feast, Interstellar is perfect, but the movie inevitably wants to preach which robs much of the Sci-Fi potential.The movie pushes human elements to the story, evidently and verbally. The mission should always have to involve Cooper's sadness of letting go of his family. It could have worked if it was all that simple, but it stretches like it's as important as the survival of the human race. The real problem there is it rather feels like a plot device. Mostly a distraction, hindering the better story happening to its actual journey. To the main side of the movie, there are many interesting bits at the concept, like how the Earth falls apart isn't some destructive disaster. Instead it's just some massive climate change and dying plants. The space travel's situation however is encountering unexpected phenomena when they pass through some wormhole or visit a planet. As a narrow minded science fiction, this could have been gripping, but the movie wants some soul within its characters, but the script overdoes the monologues, which ends up sounding pretentious at attempting to be poetic. Especially the one that Brand explains whatever about love, it sounds more of a speech worth groaning at.Much of it just doesn't work at all, the drama only earns vitality when it's simply about trying to live up a promise of coming back to Earth and save humanity, but once it gets to the third act, things gone to vast absurdity for the sake of connecting their mission to the relationship of Cooper and his daughter. Some might say it's affecting, but it's more of a compromise. Thanks to its actors, it at least makes the melodrama tolerable. Aside of that concern, the space adventure is still quite the experience. Christopher Nolan has a conservative technique when it comes to visuals, but no matter how real or CG-ed the images are, they are all still pretty stunning. There is a total amazement at shots of comparing the scale of their vessel to the largeness of the galaxy, or warping into wormholes, or sights of any cold alien planet. From special effects to cinematography, the movie triumphs.Interstellar could have been more keen at showcasing its scientific concept than attempting to make inspiring pick-up lines. No matter how gorgeous the visuals are, you still couldn't completely blind yourself from its space-soap-opera that leads to a silly climax and a creepy epilogue, but the idea and technical achievements are very big merits, it provides plenty of intrigue, more mind-blowing than its dramatic dialogues. It's not that I have any problems with drama, the choices the film picks just doesn't help transcending the material. If you are only in for the journey, then prepare to be awed, because that space adventure is the best thing the film could offer: nothing more, nothing less.",Interstellar
228,Rickting,Reach for the stars,8/10,10 December 2014,"Interstellar's divided critical response is a fairly sad thing. It shows people just can't get over a blockbuster which is actually focused on something other than mindless spectacle. Easily my most anticipated film of the year, Christopher Nolan's first trip into space ignites the stars. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a lot better than my most anticipated film of 2013 (Kickass 2). The earth has become unstable due to lack of food, and Matthew McConaughey and a team of astronauts leave earth to travel through a wormhole to find a new home. Interstellar is too long, is hampered by a weak Anne Hathaway performance and has some silly moments, but it still manages to make loads of exposition interesting which is a rare feat. Of course, no-one needs me to tell them that the film looks amazing, has a fantastic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, great cinematography, fantastic direction and plenty of deep stuff involving time, love and a fair amount of philosophy.Interstellar is all of those things. What sets it apart is that there's not actually that much action and it's a deeply moving storyline with great acting. Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy are all excellent, and the film boasts one of the decade's coolest robots. With it's philosophy, big questions and commentary of humanity itself, Interstellar goes far into territory which most other modern filmmakers wouldn't even think of going to. This is a visually amazing blockbuster which has plenty of soul and doesn't even seem to focus that much on the blockbuster elements. Interstellar is unique, deep, powerful and asks many questions, which are terms which describe few other science fiction films today. Interstellar is a very good movie, which more or less lived up to my expectations. It's a slow movie, but if people (Even critics) are too ignorant to appreciate something different, we may be beyond hope. It's got its critics, but it's destined for classic status. And that's not just because I'm a Nolan fan, since I'm not a huge fan of The Dark Knight Rises or The Prestige.9/10",Interstellar
229,dilipbts,Interstellar,10/10,7 June 2020,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.

230,DareDevilKid,"Brainy, Ballsy, and Beautiful to Behold",10/10,16 November 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsChristopher Nolan has reached deep into the stars to tell a story about mankind's demise and refusal to go quietly into the night. Here is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With ""Interstellar"", Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the regularity of mathematics homework but spliced with the fantastic. The film charts a course in the latest theories in quantum physics and other space-related sciences to tell a story that engages and entertains viewers. It also goes to exacting lengths to meticulously depict the theory of relativity — vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne.Opening, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near- future setting sees humanity starving and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post-millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children lead a life of agrarian survivalism. But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth - an all-American hero. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide-eyed wonder of the Director's youth; a man for whom we are ""explorers and pioneers, not caretakers"", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope.With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. According to ""Interstellar's"" on-board astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three- dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modeled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerizing visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light; this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity.Nolan grounds his epic tale through the relationship between humans. There is a scene in the movie that shifts from deep space back to Earth, from a father (McConaughey) who hasn't aged much physically to a daughter(Chastain) all grown up. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm, son and daughter, for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earth's population.Thankfully, Nolan's helped no end by his lead, the charismatic McConaughey cementing his A-list comeback with a powerful performance that helps ground the grand proceedings and provides the film with its emotional core. Among all the space phenomena and alien terrains, it's his quieter moments that provides the film's small-scale highlights. It's also his back-and-forth banter with TARS – a former military droid with a fiercely caustic artificial intelligence (voiced by comedian Bill Irwin) – that lends the film some much needed humor amidst the solemnity of the mission at hand. Meanwhile, Nolan newbie, Chastain, and regular collaborator, Caine, provide solid Earthbound support with only fairly limited screen- time, and Hathaway adds a refreshingly down-to-earth presence to the outer-space adventure.For Nolan faithfuls, all his signature notes are also present: Michael Caine imparts wisdom in front of a blackboard, the story skips through time without a fade to black, Hans Zimmer provides a haunting score, and multiple action sequences are cut together in a frenetic crescendo. If there's one area that Nolan is visibly more comfortable with, it's tense, super-sized set pieces – and he more than delivers here. From a race against a giant, skyscraper-sized wave to some frosty fisticuffs atop a herculean glacier (meticulously shot to frame the combatants as tiny ants compared to the enormity of the icy mass they're traversing), ""Interstellar"" contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments.The production design is more ""Alien"" than ""Star Trek"", with a grimy, functional spacecraft reaching murky, yet beautifully conceived new worlds. New cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytemer, more than ably replaces Nolan's regular DOP, Wally Pfister. The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of ""Interstellar"" admirably and charmingly low-key. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes, while the film's tech – taking cues from films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"" – has a tangible, old-school quality to it, from the embryonic, sous-vide-style hyper-sleep chambers to McConaughey's clunky, faceless robot sidekick TARS. Even in the depths of new galaxies, characters still write out their trajectories on white boards and explain scientific theories using pen and paper. Ditto the movie itself, shot on film in good old- fashioned 2D. It's to Nolan and his visual effects team's credit, though, that he's still able to push boundaries despite this traditional approach: ""Interstellar"" contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive, and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen.""Interstellar"" poses all the right questions and provides some highly cerebral answers to most of them, while leaving the others rightfully unanswered. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. For the first time, Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never hitherto a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. ""Interstellar"" is a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking.As a light-year-spanning quest to save the human race, this is the director's broadest canvas by far, but also his most intimate. And against the alien backdrop of black holes, wormholes, and strange new worlds, ""Interstellar"" stands as Nolan's most human film to date.",Interstellar
231,rubenm,Disappointing,5/10,11 November 2014,"So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed.",Interstellar
232,auuwws,interstellar,9/10,5 August 2021,"An amazing movie when I watched the movie, I was watching it with great expectations and it did not disappoint me at all. The story of the movie was amazing and I did not expect a large part of it, but the ending was not up to the level required for this amazing movie. The acting in the movie was amazing from all the actors, especially from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, Usually the acting of children is very bad, but Mackenzie Foy gave an amazing performance, which is the best in my opinion in the movie, and she should have been nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the space scenes in the movie were very amazing, especially the black hole, I recommend watching the movie and my rating for the film is 8.5/10.

233,TheSquiss,"Chris Nolan astounds again. Sci-fi epic or spiritual experience, it's a mind-blowingly fine trip!",8/10,21 November 2014,"Much has been written and spoken of the plot holes in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, Interstellar. That's Nolan's science FICTION epic, Interstellar. If you want science fact, head over to The Sky at Night or listen to Professor Brian Cox. Nolan is in the entertainment business.That said, Interstellar is sufficiently plausible (note, I did not write 'realistic') to hold the attention and to prompt deep consideration of space travel and humanity's future. Heck, this is almost a spiritual experience touching on mortality beyond the physical realm.With Earth virtually devastated through drought and famine that have caused dramatic climate change and a dearth of food, humankind is on the verge of extinction. A rip in the space-time continuum is discovered and a substantially downsized NASA, led by visionary Professor Brand (Nolan stalwart Michael Caine), plans to send a select team into deep space, through a black hole and into the great unknown with the hope of saving our species. Mysterious circumstances contrive to place Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) on NASA's doorstep and he is forced to choose between watching his children grow up and saving the world.Interstellar owes much to the legacy of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact in its depth, silence and cerebral possibilities. It is a work of entertainment with occasional thrills, a few questions, much thought and some beautiful effects that will either meld or clash with your imagination. Having never found myself hurtling through a wormhole into an unchartered time, place or dimension, I have no idea what it should look like, but Nolan's vision of such a journey and the destination is colourful and ambiguous enough to prompt contemplation and debate.There are times when Interstellar strolls along, gazing at the scenery and wondering at the possibilities of space and time exploration and those sequences allow for our own reflection upon Nolan's suggestion. Like Contact before it, there is emotional tension and a spiritual journey that accompanies the physical jaunt. This is more than a film about outer space; it is a film about love and with that comes betrayal. Just as space has layers and depths we cannot comprehend (how do we truly grasp the magnitude of infinity?), love and betrayal have numerous facets and strata as Nolan depicts. Unlike Contact, Nolan endeavours to wrap his film completely in explanation and tie it with a bow for us to admire, when perhaps the ambiguity and lack of absolute definition would have been the greatest finale.Interstellar isn't the film the original trailer led me to expect. It first implied Nolan's spin on Armageddon but this isn't a gung-ho America saves the world nonsense. It may not have the emotional attachment or the startling visual effects of last year's phenomenal Gravity, but the central performances from McConaughey, Anne Hathaway (as fellow crew member, Brand) and, particularly, Jessica Chastain (as the abandoned daughter, Murph) make this an experience that resounds with us all. What would it take for you to abandon those you love? Could you see the bigger picture? Hans Zimmerman's score is beautifully redolent of Michael Nyman's best work, and it adds not just depth but character to the mystery of what lies beyond all that we understand and can define. It doesn't, however, explain how an intelligent man like Cooper can be so wrong in his explanation of Murphy's Law and we are left to wonder whether he is confused or just lying to his daughter, adding another layer to the betrayal.I'm not convinced that Interstellar is going to astound sufficiently to prompt multiple viewings in the way Gravity did, but it is yet another resounding success in Nolan's canon that can be tucked away and watched periodically in the future. That lad Michael Caine is turning out to be a pretty good muse for Christopher Nolan. Watch him, he could go far.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Interstellar
234,RevRonster,Interesting and visually stunning...but I just couldn't get invested in the story.,4/10,10 November 2014,"I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and was really excited to see ""Interstellar."" While the film started very strong and was loaded with emotional promise, the story just lost me and I quickly found myself growing bored with it.Yes, the film is visually stunning, Matthew McConaughey is awesome in his role, and the film has some very entertaining robots that provide some light-hearted and cool moments, the story's emotional impact was lost due to Nolan showing off how much he knew about science and time. While what we are presented with is interesting and neat to learn, they weren't presented in a way I felt was meshing with the story. They felt more like intermissions where the story is stopped and the audience is forced to pull out their textbooks to learn about what is going to happen. It felt like Nolan was stopping the emotional course of the story to show you all how hard he knows science.And while I loved McConaughey in the film, I felt a lot of the performances weren't coming close to what he was brining. Heck, even some of the characters come off as superfluous as they lack any real depth and feel tacked on in order to achieve the next plot device—for example, the surprise addition of a well known actor comes off as a needless villain that did little to really create tension and felt like something that was thrown in at the last minute.I still really enjoy Nolan's work and will forever admit that the visuals were gorgeous and McConaughey was very enjoyable in the film—and yes, I will say that all the science Nolan drops on us is very intriguing and cool but, in the end, I just couldn't invest myself in the story. It starts very strong but once the story took to the stars and traveling through black holes, the emphasis went from deep emotion to deep thought and that hurt the overall presentation for me. Science is pretty awesome but I just didn't see a balance of getting the human factor and the academic factor right. They didn't seem to gel and that kept me from getting fully invested in the journey to save the human race.Hello! The name is Rev.

235,bheadher,I'm wondering how this got such a good rating...,2/10,9 June 2017,"Interstellar has some good points, and some very bad points entertainment wise...First of all, the movie is extremely boring...which may tickle some people I suppose. Literally the first half of the movie is some sort of family affair for the stars, with shots of their flying a drone, and experiencing a huge dust storm at their big farm...only to have McGaunahey and his daughter go off searching for some ultra secret space base out in the boonies, where they find out there is a plan to go through a wormhole to somewhere else...Then we have a crazy robot that is a clone for the mystery obelisk in 2001. This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice...Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity...A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land ""in"" the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all...I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful...",Interstellar
236,davidgee,In a galaxy far far away,8/10,4 December 2014,"Christopher Nolan takes few prisoners in his movies. INTERSTELLAR assumes the viewer is familiar with the theory of relativity and the notion of fifth and sixth dimensions. So - a challenge to sit through for close to three hours. A challenge that tests - but rewards - the audience.Nolan pays homage to a whole raft of space movies, notably Kubrick's 2001 and Robert Zemeckis's CONTACT, with a time-continuum twist that I remember from a John Wyndham story called (I think) CHRONOCLASM. Although rarely boring, the film is a bit longer than it needs to be. There's a subplot involving Matt Damon in the galaxy far far away that seems clunky, and the science goes a bit wonky when McConaughey jumps into a Black Hole (perhaps Black Holes are open to reinterpretation). Where Nolan really hits the button is in the brave avoidance of 21st- century CGI in favour of some fine old-fashioned Special Effects. This gives INTERSTELLAR a lot of the visual magic that made 2001 such a mind- blowing voyage into the mysteries of the infinite.

237,dragokin,not as good as everyone is trying to convince you,4/10,24 December 2014,"Judging by the cast of Interstellar there is a seemingly endless roster of movie stars begging for at least a cameo in Christopher Nolan's movies. But this shouldn't come as a surprise after the success of The Dark Knight trilogy.So what did we have here? A lot of great CGI images and some truly heartbreaking moments. They were joined together by scenes that better fit an SF movie of B provenance. I don't want to go into discussing the scientific and ""scientific"" background, but the characters behave as if they were on a somewhat complicated journey to inner Antarctica and not the boundaries of outer space.The launch of Interstellar is partly a lesson in contemporary communication. Even before it's premiere the media fanfare determined that Interstellar would be a masterpiece. For some reason everyone follows without questioning the sloppy moments.

However, the plot missteps significantly in the second half before losing itself almost entirely to cater for a nice and tidy Hollywood happy ending. The strong acting and characters deliver enough science and human interest to keep the audience involved, but ultimately, the film runs on too long and doesn't spend enough time up in space.

The acting is quite good but not remarkable, but the story gets over it and you'll not notice it.
Well, there is a oversight but it doesn't bother (family truck).P.S. If you are searching for a movie with a light plot that does not request attention and with short length this will be definitely NOT the movie you are seeking for. Nolan's works require attention and some mental effort to comprehend them at all (and I love them for it).

240,judywalker2,Not as good as I thought it would be,5/10,21 April 2015,"A friend recommended this movie to me (I have to admit I didn't want to see it in theaters after seeing the trailers) so I gave it a shot as a Amazon rental. I turned on my big screen and surround sound like my friend recommended and sat back hoping to have a good time. Well I should have but I didn't. May I should have also prefaced the fact that I hated Gravity. I like Sci fi but I guess I just don't get metaphysical because this movie could have been a whole lot better it they had left a lot of that silly stuff out. It would have been great contrast the search for a new home for human kind and the struggles of the people left on earth. It also would have been great to be honest about hard choices and letting go of anger in favor of understanding. Coop is no much about science and having his children achieve that it would have been nice to have spent more time on a world where innovation has ceased in favor of food and hopelessness. Too bad.

242,bgar-80932,Very close,7/10,23 February 2019,The film had amazing acting and incredible visuals and ideas. Christopher Nolan really went all in with this one and I thought it was so close to be a classic. Every actor and actress did a great job and they really made you feel for the family getting ripped apart to try to save the human race. I really liked how they showed people's survivor instincts as well as their selfishness. That felt real. Some of the end I didn't love but it was still a really cool movie. Some of the visuals and cinematography was great and I loved the silence during the explosions. I'd say it was a little too long and I didn't love the end otherwise I'd have given this a higher score.,Interstellar
243,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,More Mind Than Matter,4/10,7 November 2014,"At one point during INTERSTELLAR, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is being told that a fifth-dimensional being is trying to logically communicate something to three-dimensional humans, and a mindblown Cooper says aloud that he still doesn't get it: So this time around, writer/director Christopher Nolan outsmarts and outfoxes both his audience and main character... Although there is a fair share of down-home simplicity...A tale about a rural farmer, longing for a purpose in life and who ends up in the far reaches of space, might seem a tad familiar... And just as we get to know Cooper and his children – living on an Earth devastated by ferocious dust storms – he alone winds up soaring to the mysterious heavens.For a three-hour film, it's a surprise that any aspect could be ""too rushed."" Yet the amount of time our potential hero goes from the ground to the sky is as quick as a few instructive paragraphs spouted by the chief NASA scientist (Michael Caine).While super-intelligence is essential in any genuine sci-fi flick, and wormholes and black holes are always an intriguing premise, there's so much explaining and anticipating what needs to be done that surprisingly, very little actually happens.These intrepid voyagers, including Anne Hathaway's straight-laced Amelia and a sarcastic robot, experience some extremely close calls and a tremendous amount of docking and spinning, but no real adventure. And whether in space or back on a future Earth two stories fusing into a M. Night Shyamalan style twist there's no one to completely root for except McConaughey, who can make any character likable.Christopher Nolan's power can't be denied: His DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY created an immense fan base nearly equaling the nostalgic likes of Spielberg, Lucas, Kubrick or any iconic director you choose But his ambitiously epic INTERSTELLAR both overreaches and overwhelms Not just the audience and characters, but the genre itself: With so many complicated instructions we hardly see the damn thing work!",Interstellar

245,bbickley13-921-58664,"Well it was worth experiencing in IMAX, but it was no Dark Knight (or Memento)",9/10,6 November 2014,"This is not Christopher Nolan's best picture or the picture that I hyped it up to be. Coming out almost a year after Gravity, I was expecting something as mind capturing as that, since both flicks take place in space, and even though Interstellar had moments of great suspense, in-between were too many moments of lackluster drama.The story of a small group of men and women (Well one woman, Anne Hathaway) who must travel beyond our solar system to find a new home for the human race, was told beautifully though the Visual effects. Watching the astronauts travel to the end of the solar system, through a black hole, and explore planets were humans can occupy was exciting. Nolan attempted to make this journey as real as possible, and completely worthy of the extra cash I spend for the 70mm screen.The second story of a father, played charmingly by Matthew McConaughey, struggling with leaving his children behind in order to save the human race, and desperately wanting to get back to them was emotional and, touching, and fueled the entire movie, but it also felt like it was rushed through. I have a theory that Nolan could have done this on purpose to tie in on one of the movie's themes, the relevance of time. Weather I'm accurate or not, the dramatic pull was very iffy. You felt it, but not really.With Dark knight, Nolan was able to balance a big budget with great story telling. I'm starting to think it was no coincidence that Batman is not a concept Nolan and his brother, Jonathan thought up on their own.Memento was a perfect movie without the need of a hundred million dollars, but it seems every time Nolan gets his hands on some big money to tell his own story, it suffers a little, and I never thought he was that type of director. Maybe he has not mastered that art of telling a story through Visual effects like I've given him so much credit for.Overall, Nolan's homage to 2001 a Space Odyssey was enjoyable. If you like Inception at all, than you will like Interstellar.",Interstellar
246,harryplinkett14,Everything went wrong,1/10,9 August 2020,"I believe this screenplay came about when director Nolan met M Night Shyamalan at a party and jotted down a bunch of ideas for a sci-fi movie that Shyamalan got after drinking half a pint of vodka. The screenplay contains all the weirdness and confusion you find in a bad Shyamalan film. Add some rather boring action, and you get 'Interstellar'. What is this mess of a movie? There is enough material here for an epic sci-fi, a drama, a supernatural thriller, and an action movie. And that's a bit too much. There are too many plot lines and tonal shifts, and it doesn't help that the whole thing is way too confusing for anyone to comprehend what's going on. How many philosophical issues does this film raise, anyhow? Next time, try one. Not twenty. And try and provide some emotional payoff in the end. I can't believe this film got such good reviews. It is amateurish nonsense.

247,JoelChamp85,They Captured A Dream,10/10,19 March 2021,"Beyond a well made and amazing VFX space exploration film, Interstellar captures one of the closest efforts to a real dream projected on screen I've ever seen. If your parents pass away at a young age, and that's how you forever remember them, then in your dreams you would only see them at that age. Even when you become old and grey, and you surpass their dying age, you would continue dreaming of them as young adult. This film really captured that for me. Plus the great performances of the actors and intense soundtrack really sells it.

248,PyroSikTh,A Cross Between Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey,9/10,8 November 2014,"Interstellar is Nolan's next big movie, and the best way to describe it is a cross between Nolan's own Inception and Stanley Kubrick's 2001. It has all the long tension of Inception, including cutting between two different building stories so that they reach their conclusion at the same time. This creates a lot of nail-biting suspense, the same as it did in Inception. However, apply that suspense, today's effects, and the modern way of making and presenting a movie to 2001, and you've got Interstellar in a nutshell (complete with off-the-wall, surreal climax at the end).The world is dying, overtaken by dust and dirt, disrupting and killing crops. Humanity is a mess; everyone's a farmer and the quest for science is almost nonexistent. Cooper is an ex-astronaut who, just like everyone else, has resigned to keeping his own farm. However it's not enough for him and he craves space exploration more than ever, so when he finds a binary message in the dirt, he follows it's message into another galaxy to save humanity.Interstellar is a very scientific movie. It's all pro-science, showing us what a world without interest in science would look like, which has become a bit of a hot topic recently it seems. In one scene Cooper points out how the lack of MRI's in the world (having been stripped for farming parts) essentially killed his wife. Likewise there's a certain attention to realism, at least to a point. For example all the space vehicles aren't the pristine, sci-fi gadgetry we've come accustomed to seeing of a future vision, but weathered and efficient. Their interiors look like the interior of the ISS today.However Interstellar isn't like Gravity in that realism is the sole aim. It relishes in it's sci-fi surroundings, playing with somewhat more supernatural elements. The film is permeated with the mystery of ghosts and aliens, and as I mentioned before, the big finale takes a surreal route, not too dissimilar to 2001's LSD sequence. While it has these realistic moments and this bombastic sci-fi moments, it ties them together nicely with some elements that bridge the gap in the middle. Every planet is made to seem like a plausible place to exist, with oceans, mountains, clouds, glaciers etc, however they're also very alien in that they hold features unlike anything we've seen before, such as clouds that have frozen in mid-air, creating a sheet of ice and snow floating above the ground, or tidal waves so massive they're mistaken for mountains. The other way they bridge the gap is by exploring the most up-to-date scientific understandings and taken them a little further. The biggest and most obvious example is of black holes, of which one makes a significant point of the movie. Rather than being a 2-dimensional circle as often depicted, it's a black orb surrounded by swirling light in multiple directions. It plays with gravity and time, but isn't imminently dangerous. It even gives the Nolan's an opportunity to play with the idea of going beyond the event horizon. Physically impossible because you'd die from the increased gravity before you got there, but this is another liberty they take with their sci-fi approach.The visual effects are out of this world (pun intended). They manage to strike the subtle balance between believability and sci-fi fantasy, which makes this alien worlds with their alien features come alive, as if they're actual places that exist and are being explored. My wife did note that Saturn's rendering did just look like an art project, but at the end of the day it's a ball of gas. There isn't really much more detail you can put into it. What did strike me about that scene was the attention to scale. All too often in movies, the ship is portrayed as actually being quite big compared to the planet it's passing or about to land on. The Interstellar ship (Endurance) is just a tiny speck in the corner.Interstellar is a great movie for sure. It impacted me so much I left the cinema in silence, and I spent the last hour getting my mind blown over and over again. However I can't say it's perfect. It plays around with a lot of ideas, but not all of them quite work, the Inception-style cutting to build tension achieves the same results, but generally feels a lot messier as the story lines don't really tie together quite as well, McConaughey's mumble just comes across as trying to hard to win an award, and the Earth-based storyline doesn't hold anywhere near the same amount of suspense, just because it inherently has less at stake. It's also a really long movie, which isn't really a problem for me, but it spends an awful lot of time on a random planet with a random character that doesn't really amount to much beyond offering a HAL-type antagonist. In my opinion they could've stripped that straight down, if not cut it out completely, and saved quite a bit of time without ruining the pacing of the movie. All things considered, I give Interstellar a fantastic 9/10. It's definitely a must-watch, despite it's flaws.",Interstellar
249,CinematicInceptions,Excellently crafted and inspiring story. Only slightly lacking in character.,9/10,28 September 2015,"Do not go gentle into this movie. I know that sounded cheesy but it's true. You need to pay close attention to everything while watching this, particularly at the beginning. It's not as bad as Inception or Primer in terms of how much technical information you need to absorb to follow the ending, but you can't miss much and hope to have a full grasp. I had a pretty good handle Interstellar after only one very intent viewing, but I still had to do some research to clarify a few points.At it's core, the film is about the incredible will and capability of the human race, as we see with the characters making sacrifices for their families and all of humanity, as all of us do on a smaller scale each day. But subliminally it's a warning to us all that we are slipping into that fallen state of humanity where we can no longer advance, only survive. Murph's teacher says that somewhere in our near future there was an extreme famine due to bad prioritizing by all of humanity. So despite the themes of how much humanity is capable of, I think Nolan is also suggesting that we really aren't living up to that right now.Our main plot line follows Cooper, a retired pilot who holds on to his idealized views of the past while still recognizing the plights of the present. If you've seen the trailers, you likely already know the basic plot line: Cooper goes on a space mission to find new planets for humanity to inhabit. However, the plot is much more complex than that and involves a decent amount of science with the black hole slowing down time and Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) need to find a way to harness the five dimensions. In a lot of sci-fi movies, you can just accept the supernatural rules of the given fictional universe and not worry too much about the technical bits of it, but that's not the case here. Every detail of the mission that is explained is just as important for the audience to know as it is for the characters. The secondary plot line shows Cooper's daughter Murph helping Prof. Brand make Plan A, the salvation of humanity still on earth, possible through failed scientific equations. There are some emotional subplots as well like Cooper trying to see his family again by making Plan A work, Brand (Anne Hathaway) believing that love can be a logical means of decision-making, Prof. Brand's knowledge of the futility of Plan A, and Mann trying to kill Cooper and take control of the Endurance. One thing I really loved about the overall plot was that there was a very definite ticking clock at all times, but it wasn't like the overused time-bomb clock that we usually see to where the world is saved from spontaneous destruction at the very last second.Our protagonist, Cooper goes through a lot of emotional struggle that pretty much everyone in the audience can relate to somehow. You're meant to agree and sympathize with him at pretty much every point, which you might not like if you prefer more realistic heroes that choose to do the wrong thing sometimes. But in defense of Coop's humanity, he doesn't really make moral choices so much as he chooses certain philosophies to follow that others around him disagree with. Murph is our C-line protagonist, and also experiences a lot of emotion, mostly anger at NASA and her dad. We only see clips of her life, but it's clear that she, like Brand's daughter and Cooper, is motivated by emotion as well as science, logic, and intelligence. Professor Brand is a typical Michael Caine/Nolan movie role as the mentor of a much younger protagonist, though here he is not quite as infallible as usual. His daughter Amelia serves as a check for Cooper's emotion, though her own internal conflict isn't given much prominence. Mann (Matt Damon) has only a little screen time, but is our main antagonist. The minor characters consist of Romily, Doyle, Coop's son, and I guess TARS and CASE count as characters. None of them are developed that well, which is too bad, but there's only so much depth you can put into so many characters.The film is very visually appealing with the magnificent settings, which I've heard were mostly filmed in physical locations. There isn't really any action to speak of, but there are a lot of intense scenes that feel a bit like action sequences. The science is thorough enough that you buy it, but there are a few things that are more fiction than science (e.g. the 5 dimensional black hole at the end). For people who are sticklers to realism, I would please ask that you just deal with the more far-fetched elements. Nit-picking the factual problems is missing the point of the movie, and there's a pretty impressive amount of realism all things considered. The acting wasn't spectacular, but it was fine for the most part, though I thought Murph's child actress was much better than her adult one.I would say that this is worth spending money on and should definitely be watched in a quiet setting. I watched it in two sittings and found it helpful to look up a few of the scientific technicalities in between to help clarify some confusion. If you're a Nolan fan, go ahead and buy this straight away if you're tempted to. If not, rent it anyway. A last note: I've heard that this has a lot of similarities to 2001 A Space Oddesey. While I haven't seen it, I can say with certainty that it is not the same story. The same goes for Star Wars and Star Trek. Every sci-fi plot basis is going to be repeated, but that doesn't mean that the movies are the same. Overall Rating: 9.1/10.",Interstellar
250,MattBrady099,Do not go gentle into that good night.,9/10,9 November 2014,"Dr. Brand: ""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"".The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A space odyssey was his all time favorite film and he wanted to do a small tribute to his work in Nolan's next film, and then comes Interstellar a movie that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience.I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me. The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since well 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won a Oscar for that.Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie, it's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it. My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's with a interesting story line that will keep you interested.",Interstellar
251,Al_The_Strange,Interstellar Review,9/10,10 November 2014,"There always comes a time when children have to leave their parents. As children of the Earth, human beings may someday have to face a terrifying decision: leave mother Earth in search for a new home, or remain here to die. In the film Interstellar, mankind approaches this crossroad when the very dust of the Earth turns against us: a bleak future that mirrors the dustbowl, but on a global scale. As the film goes on, it becomes apparent that, thanks to the valor of the characters, we will not ""go quietly into the night."" Space opera films are slow-burners by nature, and Interstellar is no exception. Although it runs more briskly than most, it still takes its time with the narrative. The first act is dedicated solely to the Earth-based drama (a bit along the lines of like The Right Stuff), which sets the scene and the necessity for the mission that follows. Once the characters reach space, the film's visual splendor emerges, offering stunning views of Saturn, of wormhole travel, of far-away planets, and more. The conflicts are subtle, but they come to a full boil towards the end, before the film delivers a really bizarre reality-bending twist. The denouement is ultimately satisfying, although it does leave off with a few loose strands that the audience will have to reconcile on their own.What makes Interstellar especially noteworthy will be its creditability. Regardless of how far-out the plot goes, the film sports some very real-looking designs for the spaceships, robots, and Earth-based scenes. The depictions of black holes, wormholes, planets, and all their related phenomenon (including the laws of gravity, relativity, time, and extra dimensions) are handled far more realistically than most other films on the market. The film even manages to visually represent what a tesseract could look like; I personally never thought that extra-dimensional space could be portrayed on film at all, but Interstellar succeeds in a plausible manner.Unfortunately, the experience may be spoiled for many by various issues. The film has a penchant for exposition, including detailed explanations of the science involved. There are moments where the music and sound design drowns out the dialogue. There are moments where characters act less than rational. The film also makes an overt attempt to really yank on the audience's heartstrings. Whether or not these same issues affect you may depend on your disposition on Christopher Nolan's other work (in which a lot of the same issues are apparent, especially in Inception), and the genre.Despite those contrivances and script issues, I found the story to be quite impressive. It is a grand tale with a lot of big, high-concept ideas. The film's story meticulously weaves the characters, plot, and science in a tight knot. It is ultimately twisted around on itself to form a complex, but easily-digestible moebius strip of a tale. What makes it most endearing will be its characters, which show a tremendous amount of heart and emotional power, and the themes. The film makes some very bold assertions on human progress, suggesting that the stars hold our destiny, in addition to overarching ideas of love, life, and death.The film is well-made, featuring quality photography. There are impressive visual moments throughout the film, but it's rarely frivolous. Sharp and quick editing ensures that the film uses only what it needs to for the storytelling. The actors do their jobs well: Matthew McConaughey is quite spot-on as the main character, and I enjoyed the performances of Anne Hathaway, and David Gyasi. I found Matt Damon's and Wes Bently's characters the least endearing, but not necessarily because of their performances. Michael Caine and John Lithgow are effectively typecast in their signature smart-old-guy roles. Despite all the clunky exposition, writing is pretty decent. This production has really functional and real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are phenomenal. Locales are great. Hans Zimmer's music score is majestic and powerful, and really adds to the experience. As noted before though, the mixing of the music, sound, and dialogue could have been done better in some scenes.Not everybody will be captivated by Interstellar - some may find it dull, overrated, annoying, contrived, or something. As far as space operas go though, it is as strong of a film as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, with themes and intellect that can rival Tarkovsky's Solaris. It is a natural evolution of Nolan's storytelling prowess, which he exercised previously in Memento and Inception. For its strengths as a story and film (and especially as a work of hard sci-fi), Interstellar is worth seeing at least once.4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",Interstellar
252,ArchonCinemaReviews,Nolan's metaphysical space movie is visually stunning but obviously takes inspiration from peers,8/10,19 February 2015,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar takes inspiration from its science fiction peers and predecessors for a truly captivating story of survival.Set in the not-so-distant future, Interstellar tells of an Earth with increasingly scarce and depleted resources and humanity on the brink of potential extinction.The human race faces certain death as the land and planet they have called home is racked with drought, famine and an unstable climate. What follows is the common tale of survival as scientists and astronauts must look across the universe to an alternative planet that has the potential to sustain life. A crew of four manning the Endurance must venture off into space, across time and through wormholes. Interstellar is not just an exciting adventure but a metaphysical exploration of love, science and the human condition.If you've ever seen a science fiction film that delve into the ideas of time and space travel then the plot of Interstellar will be exceedingly familiar and, at times, unoriginal and predictable. This is not to say that the film is unoriginal; as it is innovative, thoughtful and the visuals are spectacular. The material from which Christopher and Jonathan Nolan take inspiration for their film is so conspicuous that it is clear that Interstellar is paying homage to its predecessors. Anyone who has seen a science fiction film over the past twenty years should be able to discern the themes within Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's film and deduce the 'twists', plot progression and even ultimate outcome of the film. With that one flaw aside, Interstellar is an exceptional movie that earns distinction amongst the greats of the sci-fi sub genre.There is so much good to be said of Interstellar that it is difficult to know where to begin. Most striking, distinct and resonating are the mind-blowing visuals and powerful score. Within Interstellar there's extremely dense material regarding physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, of which the Nolans make approachable and understandable for a wide audience. Further, to the undiscerning viewer it appears that Nolan takes no creative liberties when translating these ideas into awe-inspiring visuals. And then there is the masterful score by Hans Zimmer. Gone is the subtlety of nuanced and understated sound to complement the scene and instead Zimmer's score is an integral aspect of the action.Interstellar is a long film that stretches over 160 minutes, and in these one hundred and sixty minutes there are multiple moments in the film that had served as the conclusion in previous space films. And yet Nolan's Interstellar surpasses these plot points and surges forward to a hopefully cathartic and resolving conclusion.Please check out our WEBSITE for full reviews of all the recent releases and awards contenders.",Interstellar
253,MovieCriticOnline,Super disappointed,3/10,26 August 2019,"This was called CONTACT starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey.Not sure, but Nolan has a knack for not so great story telling, with the exception of Dark Knight. Again, movie starts and you don't find out when and where you are. Random interviews with random people talking about the past but again you don't know who they are. Frustrating.Second, the cast was bad and so was the acting. Hathaway as a NASA scientists? Come on. The cliche old wise man played by Michel Caine, we've seen it a million times. It was the general woke cast, a woman, a black guy, two white dudes. The voice of the robot is unbelievably annoying.It is so poorly written and explained. The expositions were lazy and tired old ""speeches"" giving us information.Just a little bit of a drive away from Joseph Cooper is a secret space station he happens to stumble upon after some ""miracle"" dust gathering in his house gives him the signal and of course, once he arrives, they want him to pilot the space ship, because ""he is the only one that can."" LOL Is this real life? Holy crap, it's written by a 13 year old.Of course there are worm holes too... it all so nice and cozy package together.This movie could have just started with a brief montage of earth being desolate and food scarce and then start the mission.

I felt everything!!!,10/10,22 March 2015,"Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine.In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.

255,pfgpowell-1,Rattling good sci-fi hokum - enjoy and stop quibbling,7/10,25 September 2015,"Reading the reviews here on IMDb as I do after watching a film, I am yet again surprised at how many of those posting them seem to forget that films are primarily intended as entertainment. OK, it's not pure science but as entertainment Christopher Nolan's Interstellar scores heavily: it's got most of what you need. There's intrigue, a daft but not too daft plot, humour, suspense, sentiment, loads and loads of hokum – boy do we love hokum – and, as this is sci-fi, loads of pseudo-science.On top of all that, there's impressive cinematography and special effects (though the score isn't up to much, I have to admit). So of those who criticise Interstallar for being scientific gobbledegook I would respond: would you really criticise a Porsche sports car for not making a great cup of coffee? Yes, the science is hokum and you don't have to be a scientist to know that. But that really isn't the point.I'm not an unreserved Christopher Nolan fan and I thought his Batmans to be ponderous and even rather dull. But the lad does know how to conjure up a spectacle and here he does it in spades. There's also a rather touching story of how a father keeps his promise to his daughter and enough middle-brow profundity to satisfy most adolescents of all ages.There a far more respectable sci-fi films dealing with similar subject matter – Jodie Foster's Contact is a good example – but, to get back to my first point, Nolan's Interstellar is intended as entertainment and in that respect it fires on all cylinders.So ignore the geeks who point out that 'what they do is impossible' – of course it is. But that's not the point. Just enjoy the ride. And if, like me, you come close to shedding a quiet tear at the end when Dad (at the centre of a black hole, no less, several million light years away in a different galaxy) manages to communicate – by Morse code – with the young daughter (back on Earth in real time) whose heart he broke when he first agreed to star in Nolan's epic – sorry, travel into space to save mankind – you can be sure the film ain't at all bad. Which it isn't.If you want science, go off and study science while we get on with enjoying the film.",Interstellar

That's the huge downfall. You need to be in the right mood to watch it. The actors, OMG it's a huge cast!!!!!! All in all it's not a 8.6 out of 10. It's somewhere in the 6s, because you have to be in the right mood and have a lot of time on your hands.

257,TaylorYee94,"Are you kidding me? Love transcends time, space, dimension? SERIOUSLY?",5/10,11 May 2021,"I can't believe people are falling for this nonsense. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a Science Fiction, and I don't see any science but only fiction. Emotions are delivered without the interruption of time, and the future of the humanity depends on whom you like better. Come on, this is not a science project for elementary school students. Compared to 'Gravity', scientific research and validation of 'Interstellar' are just... forgotten.SF genre's primary step to success is that the director has to makes the audience understand the core concept; even just one concept is enough. Nolan tries to realize his vision of five dimensional space which can control the time as well. I got that one, but he jams up too many things, black hole, wormhole, gravity, human instinct, aging, and even some philosophical questions .... without any explanation. Inception was such a masterpiece because Nolan walks through the movie right along with the audience. This dream world in his head is actualized on screen, and the audience takes in, understands, absorbs, and lives in with characters in the movie because foundation, characteristics, advantages & disadvantages of his world are all well explained not by someone's lines but from enough actions and visualization. Nolan seems to become more arrogant 'you guys should already know this' kind of attitude. You can see more of his arrogance in his later work, 'Tenet', complex and ambiguous more than ever. Now, I'm not sure even he understands what he is saying. SOSOSO overrated because it's Christopher Nolan. Guys be honest, and assume that 'Interstellar' is released under the name of an unheard new director. Are you still going to idolize this movie?",Interstellar
258,TheExpatriate700,Intelligent Science Fiction,7/10,24 December 2014,"Interstellar is an interesting, thoughtful science fiction film with a good cast. It depicts a near future where an environmental disaster has sent Earth into an irreversible decline, forcing humanity to seek a new home in another galaxy. Although it is not as good as Christopher Nolan's other work, it still rises above most other blockbuster, high budget sci-fi.A number of factors make Interstellar better than average. First of all, it avoids the clichéd film apocalypse with lots of CGI explosions and a central villain. In this movie, the world dies not with a bang, but a whimper as our food crops gradually die out. It also gives interesting consideration to the social effects of such a catastrophe. More importantly, it treats the audience as at least somewhat intelligent. Although I'm certain Neil DeGrasse Tyson could pick it apart on Twitter if he so desired, the film attempts to be somewhat scientifically plausible, incorporating relativity theory and even a mathematical equation as major plot points. It's disturbingly rare for movies in recent years to aim at an intelligence level above that of a thirteen year old.The film also benefits from good designs of its space ships and robots. The robots deserve particular mention. Rather than the typical humanoid looking designs, the filmmakers created a genuinely original, even plausible robot.The main weak point in the film is that it tries to insert too optimistic an ending, when the story really wasn't building to one. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching.",Interstellar
259,joelwatchesmovies,An incredible film weighed down in part by some heavy exposition,8/10,2 November 2020,"The years-long save-the-world plot, poignant near-future setting, and infinite themes both heady and heartfelt are all undeniably epic and compelling, and while the exposition weighs quite heavy at times (see the repeat of the ghost revelation), it doesn't stop the film from reaching many incredible cinematic heights both emotional (see the devastating return from Miller's planet) and action-oriented (see the spinning dock sequence), helped as it is by stunning visuals, music, and performances.

260,Just-A-Girl-14,Interesting but long and confusing,6/10,15 September 2019,"It's not a bad movie but it's also not as amazing as people say it is. The cast is great, the story is interesting but it's just too long and complicated. The more I think about it, the more confused I'm. Maybe it's me, maybe I just didn't get it but I don't think this movie makes a lot of sense. I also didn't like the ending. All throughout the movie we want to see the reunion between the father and the daughter and in the end it's something between weird and sad. If you're crazy for sci-fi movies, give it a try. If not, I'd probably skip it.

261,diac228,Interstellar is like the comedian having to explain and dissect the now-magicless joke.,5/10,22 November 2014,"Interstellar is like trying to consume a 10-inch slice of pizza in your mouth without chewing: we know the pizza is always good, and we know that the more pizza the better, but then after a point it becomes pure overkill. That is what Interstellar is: cinematic overkill that overstays its welcome, overstays its logic, and lingers around long enough for you to notice the rapidly-thinning plot. The technical aspects were indeed spectacular in every sense of the way, which arguably keeps the movie afloat for as long as it possibly can before the third act weighs everything down with its left field conclusion.What really limits Interstellar more than anything else is the plot and the script. Movies that use a backdrop as vast and expansive as space needs a smaller story to keep the audience and the logic in check. This is what worked for Wall-E, Gravity, and to a lesser extent 2001: A Space Odyssey. With Interstellar however, too much is explained, and the audience is required to make massive leaps of faith that we may not be willing to make---especially after already going through two hours of it. The dialogue is slightly overblown and loses authenticity, and by the climax too much is being discussed and not enough is being shown.The performances and the technical details keep the dialogue and story from disappointing us too much. Matthew McConaughey carries this film well as he becomes simply a man concerned about the future of his family in the midst of the grand space adventure that takes too many twists and turns that requires a second viewing to fully realize it all. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine did a swell job with the minimal material handed to them. They each added a sense of believability to a plot that was quite devoid of them as the movie went on.The cinematography and special effects were top-notch, although they suffered a few setbacks if you compare them to 2013's Gravity. Interstellar hides its space scope with far too many closeups of the crew in the space station, when there was an entire universe to be explored. The other locales themselves were quite lacking in eyecandy and creativity, leading to us longing for more scenes of outer space.Also hurting this film was that too much was happening at the same time, not in plot but in presentation. Sometimes the dialogue audio was battling the musical score and sound effects, resulting in a loud mass that made it tough to hear and comprehend the scene. In the case of Gravity and 2001, it was made sure the music was front and center, toning down just slightly when dialogue was needed to be said.Christopher Nolan is a go-big-or-go-home type of director. Simplicity is not in his resume, he loves his stories and films complex, full of wonder, full of questions, and full of awe-inspiring scenes. However, simplicity is what is definitely lacking in Interstellar. If the film spent more time showing instead of telling, then we would have had a better visual feast ahead of us. A movie of this kind, with so much room to explore, needs to be more like Jurassic Park (simple, yet incredibly thrilling) and less like Contact (psychologically and philosophically inducing).I truly wanted to enjoy this movie, considering the time, effort, and sheer labor put in to this cinematic space opera. But the entire affair was too bloated, too overdone, and just altogether didn't leave much to the imagination. Each of the pieces were good from the acting to the directing to the cinematography to the special effects. But altogether none of it really meshed, even with a running time of over 160 minutes.In space, nobody can hear you. In the movie theater however, every yawn can indeed be heard, now matter how pretty it looked...",Interstellar
262,david-meldrum,"A thrillingly, gloriously flawed film with big ideas that demands to be seen.",8/10,13 November 2014,"Big budgets and creativity don't often go together. Limitations force us to be creative, to think and plan and dream; effectively unlimited resources too often mean a death to original thinking and problem-solving. Director Christopher Nolan may just be proving himself to be an exception to this rule: his smaller, early films like Memento and The Prestige are creative, intriguing, involving and engaging; all qualities found in mega-budget Inception and the occasion he was handed the reins of that most precious of commercial enterprises, Batman (in the form of his trilogy Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises). All of these are films which throw spectacle as well as ideas at the viewer, expecting the audience to work as well as be wowed.Interstellar is the synthesis of this, a dizzying spectacle almost impossible to describe or articulate. It's science-fiction set in a future where humanity's food sources are dwindling out- of-control; a solution must be found elsewhere. What follows involves space-travel, space-ships and some very big philosophical and scientific ideas.If all that sounds like the stuff of fan-boy culture, you'd be doing yourself and the film a grave dis-service; the opening act is earth-bound and centred around what becomes the film's key relationship – father-daughter. For all the hyper-reality and wow factor that follows, this is seeking to be a very human story.Watching Interstellar and then trying to form a coherent opinion of it is like trying to self- diagnose after beaten about the head by one of Pacific Rim's gargantuan robots. That's not to suggest the film is clumsy; it's that it's so overwhelming, so expansive, so  big  that you're left grasping for a response that actually does justice to the experience of seeing the film. It's far from perfect – the script is clunky, at times giving in to some laboured plot exposition; it sometimes feels like a blessing that the sound mix is such that some lines are near-drowned out by Hans Zimmer's intense, searing score. That means that the actors don't really shine; especially those with a lot to do. The best performances are more to the fringe than the centre – especially striking is Mackenzie Foy as the 10-year old daughter, carrying an emotionally laden part that's vital to the plot and the especially the film's first third with a disarming ease. Nolan regular Michael Caine is on fine form; Matthew McConaughey struggles gamely with the inadequate script in the central role, and comes up short.The film wants to ask big questions of the nature of reality, belief and existence; questions so big that it's impossible to articulate them properly even in a near-three hour running time. It's also trying to hymn the human capacity for the extraordinary; it does that successfully, with room to spare. For me however, it runs that alongside a deep awareness of humanity's over- arching arrogance, capacity for self-destruction and the ability to ignore that which is self- evident. For all the wonder, the film never feels naive or misty-eyed.In the end, it's an essential, flawed experience; one of the few films that can tip such obvious references to works of the scope of 2001: A Space Odyssey and not seem ridiculous; that's big enough in vision to ignore the lazy temptations of a third-dimension; the reach of which exceeds its grasp but somehow that's all part of the experience, exactly appropriate for what the film is portraying.Christopher Nolan has made many all-round better films, and will make more; but he will not make one that does such full justice to the purpose and experience of cinema as an art form. Neither will he make one as satisfying in its vision despite its failures; nor is it likely that any film, Nolan's or anyone's, will make you feel the way this will. It demands to be seen on a screen big enough to do justice to its ambition and scope.",Interstellar
263,p-jonsson,I cannot believe the ridiculously hight ratings Interstellar has received,4/10,5 April 2015,"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.The movie starts of with the usual ""I told you so"" wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a ""save the human race"" mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense! The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design? The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",Interstellar
264,johnnymacbest,Chris Nolan outshines himself once again.,9/10,23 November 2014,"If there ever was a time that movies can be magical, thought-provoking, emotional, humorous, and at times, dark and disturbing, then this would be it. A work of genius on all levels, Nolan's latest bundle of joy is ""Interstellar"", one of the best films I've ever seen coming from the impeccable caliber of Nolan's pedigree for bringing out best acting performances against the backdrop of stellar and awe-inspiring visuals.The plot goes like this. Earth is in a bind and the only way to save what remains of humanity is to travel to the farthest reaches of space, to find the answers to mankind's salvation. But along the way, stunning revelations and deep character emotions are brought to the surface as the fate of humanity hangs in the proverbial and perpetual balance.I won't say too much about the plot, and although it starts slow(which to some viewers may be off-putting but for me it was perfect)the more it unravels the more exciting and enthralling it is to witness. And all of this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for Nolan's impeccable directing, sharp and well-written dialog, along with the best performances from Matthew McConaughey, Michael Cain, and of course, Anne Hathaway. With this caliber of acting talent, nothing can go wrong;especially a film of Nolan's making. There is action, but it is not as prevalent in Nolan's earlier films, and for me, that is refreshing; making the audience focus more on the story and characters, rather than the wham-pow theatrics of other films. There's a time and place for such things, but here, it is all the more welcome.Although I'm sure some will say that this film borrows from other films, and to an extent, I somewhat agree. But this film is something really special to see. Not only do we get discussions on sacrifice, the nature of mortality and morality, heroism, and longing for a more innocent time, but also on many scientific theories on wormholes, interstellar travel, the vast and often, loneliness of space,and hope in the face of despair and anguish, and Nolan handles these themes with style and grace with many heartwarming moments of warmth and love. As a fan of science-fiction, I love this film wholeheartedly. And even I was convinced that some of what's in the film could one day become science fact: What if man can travel much farther in space then we are capable now? What if we can discover 3 to 4 dimensional space? And what if we can achieve time travel? These are questions that this film leaves, and though there are no easy answers, it is nonetheless, absolutely RIVETING to even think about such possibilities as to what can be achieved.I'd say this film is like a Greek tragedy of man challenging the gods and whether or not they will succeed in such a feat. But after seeing this film and being absolutely BLOWN AWAY by it, I'm just anxious to see what Nolan and co come up with next. ""Interstellar"" directed by acclaimed director Christopher Nolan, is one of the best films I've seen this year and is bound to be a timeless classic.",Interstellar

266,rooee,The White Knight Rises,8/10,10 November 2014,"Matthew McConaughey's renaissance breaks the stratosphere with his role as would-be-world-saver Cooper, a failing farmer eking out an existence on a future Earth that's turned hostile as a result of The Blight. It's a bad one, folks – bad enough to necessitate humankind's exodus. Ex-pilot Cooper is one of those chosen to take a shuttle through a wormhole in search of a habitable planet. Trouble is, his daughter, Murphy (The Conjuring's luminous Mackenzie Foy), is desperate for her dad to stay. It's no spoiler to reveal that Cooper does not heed her protests. Theory of Relativity fans will be aware of the temporal discrepancy that means a few hours for Cooper could mean decades on Earth.The film is broadly split into three sections: rural Earth; the interstellar journey; and finally what happens next. Suffice to say, the less you know the better. Plus it's fun playing a game of spot the famous face as new characters are introduced. The first section is pure Spielberg in the way it positions an idyllic family in the midst of an existential crisis. It's the best part of the film, full of smart dialogue and affecting relationships. The problems start when Cooper and Murph find their way to the scientists, led by Michael Caine's Professor Brand, who have their sights set on deep space. It's a breeding ground for exposition, of course, and thus a breeding ground for the Nolans' worst screen writing impulses. Some explanation is necessary, one might argue, for the mission at hand. But it follows Cooper into space, resulting in the ludicrous spectacle of characters revealing stuff that would surely have been covered back at base before liftoff.What could – should – have been an adventurous middle section of the movie, wherein Cooper and crew explore lost planets with mind-boggling physical anomalies, is fatally undermined by the decision to continually cut back to events on Earth, where those left behind grow old and argumentative. Nolan has often used the technique of showing multiple dramatic threads simultaneously. At its best this is effective, but it's only as gripping as its weakest thread – and parents bickering about coughing kids just isn't that exciting. Whatever sense of deep space isolation there might have been is virtually ruined by less immediate terrestrial concerns.It's a weird decision because what happens 'out there' is more than dramatically sufficient. The places the team visit are not just dramatic and imaginative but eerily plausible. This is sci-fi of the harder variety. A pity, then, that the editing goes out of its way to kill any sense of clarity about where characters actually are in relation to each other. It's ironic, given how over-plotted and over-explained so much of the mid-section is, that Nolan chooses to render relative space itself a mystery. There are times when I assumed characters occupied the same room, only to discover through some panicked exclamation that they were in entirely separate spacecraft.While it may be difficult to abide its structure, it's easy to admire Interstellar for its humanist message, not least because this represents a change of thematic direction for its director. This is no puzzle. It's more Signs than Inception. At times this does, however, leave one with the sense that Nolan is pulling himself in two directions. His Kubrickian technical precision, all hard lines and exact framing, is at war against that soft-hearted Spielbergian glow. Like Two-Face these impulses are never really reconciled.The film that Interstellar most resembles is Robert Zemeckis's sci-fi masterpiece Contact – another work of epic sci-fi in which the galactic journey is mirrored against a journey into the heart. Love as a force beyond the reach of modern science is hardly a new concept. But Contact had a thematic ace up its sleeve in the form of Ellie Arroway's desperate 'search' for her dead father: grief incomprehensible and irreconcilable. Science and sentimentality wedded elegantly. Interstellar has a similar hook but overcomplicates matters by pushing the stakes beyond discovery, beyond the grief of loss, to the fate of the very species. Arroway said they should have sent a poet, but here we're reminded that there's no time for poetry or awe when the mission requires such haste. It's a matter of necessity, not curiosity. Humanity wasn't ""meant"" to make its survival back on Earth, we're told. No one ever counters this repeated assertion by asking whether humanity was ""meant"" to survive at all.One could go on and name the other intelligent sci-fi movies referenced by Interstellar, from Solaris through Silent Running to The Right Stuff, but this would be to suggest that it doesn't have an identity of its own. While the relationships between Cooper and his human crew are frankly less convincing than the one between he and the friendly robot (Bill Irwin), the relationship between Cooper and his daughter is deeply affecting. The three best scenes in the movie involve these two characters, face-to-face, each time with a different emotional dynamic, each time with equal conviction. The sadness of time passed is portrayed movingly: proof of an emotional heft I've not witnessed in Nolan's work before, save for glimpses in the relationship between young Bruce Wayne and his father in Batman Begins.With Interstellar, Nolan doesn't rewrite the rulebook on the genre but at times he does, as he did with his comic book trilogy, refine it. The visuals are sometimes stunning: a minute craft glinting in the shadow of Saturn; a thousand-foot ocean wave; a shapeless heavenly space, apparently adorned with every second of human existence. But at other times we're lumbered with chatter and narrative chaos, the script swinging from the simple and humorous to the cluttered and cumbersome in the blink of an eye, while HAL 9000 runs amok in the editing room. I'd like to call it a flawed masterpiece, but honestly it's just flawed. Likable, even lovable at times, but too frequently, frustratingly flawed.",Interstellar
267,Marc_Israel_365,Gritty sci-fi that emotes realism,9/10,21 March 2017,"Almost all science fiction concepts are statements regarding humanity, or the lack there-of. They require intricate concepts, not hi tech spaceships, to inspire afterthought. Here we have a mixture of realism both on the emotional aspect of the film as well as in the bells and whistles of space travel. They don't all ring true in the end as the Nolans have add fourth dimensions and love as a throwback to the silliness of other more formulated and accessible movie formats. The interesting thing here is that the Matt Damon character is such a coward, ""don't judge me"" while looking up at the ""stars"" of his grandiose existence. he represents scientists and much as anyone else in the film. It's heartbreaking as well, but that keeps us going. The pacing is the hidden gem of the film. The dust bowl effect plays well to the realism of American history and of desperate times while the science is above my pay grade, but didn't distract from my enjoyment of the experience.

Let's start at the bottom line: I'm disappointed. #12 on IMDb with 217k votes and 9.0/10 rating and comparing it to movies such as 2001 is more than overrated - it's almost a joke.This movie reminded me of Contact (also with Matthew McConaughey), Moon, Sunshine and Gravity, but all of these are in magnitude better than this movie. There is also an influence of 2001 and a wink or two to it (TARS' joke about releasing a person out of the airlock and its features which make it look like the Monolith). But on the whole, this movie isn't deep at all. Like many other Nolan movies (Inception in particular), it has a very simple idea that is extended and stretched in the movie, making it looks complex and/or epic, but it's actually pretty simple. In this movie, in particular, the writing is quite simplistic and isn't very thought-provoking. Like I said before, I think Nolan is a very capable director, but he's extremely overrated (like David Fincher).What disturbed me the most was the lack of emotion that I felt throughout most of the movie. I think I can blame Hans Zimmer for most of it. Zimmer is a fantastic composer and all his scores for Nolan movies are excellent, but in this movie he totally failed IMO. Again, it may be a combination of writing and direction, but mainly the score was lacking. There are quite a few emotional scenes that are almost stolen from Moon - but while Clint Mansell's brilliant score to Moon lift the emotion to extreme heights and can make me cry almost instantly (no matter how many times I watch Moon), Zimmer's score to this movie did almost nothing to me.Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance, especially during the emotional scenes. Ellen Burstyn is good in her tiny guest role. Jessica Chastain, which I absolutely hated in Zero Dark Thirty, isn't that great in this movie either, except for one short emotional scene which is brilliantly performed by her (I'm referring to her recorded message).While there are a few good visuals in this movie, even this aspect was quite a letdown. Gravity was MUCH more impressive in that respect.Even TARS the robot seems like it's taken from a B-movie. While I came to like some of its abilities (the running scene is my favorite), it doesn't come close to any of the qualities presented by GERTY the robot from Moon.All in all, this is an entertaining film, but really nothing more than that.5.5/10 So-so",Interstellar

270,James_De_Bello,10/10,10/10,8 November 2014,"Another masterpiece from mister Nolan. Another gem of filmaking that is totally ahead of its time. I don't even want to address the ""oh-but-you-will-love-anything-Nolan-does-no-matter-what"". You know what? If you think I'm in that mindset f*ck you. I love movie experiences and right now there is no one in the world that is better than Nolan at delivering it. So if you think I'm fanboying childishly forget it. This movie isn't just a movie, its an experience to be had in a dark room with an enormous screen, and moreover it's a philosophical statement about many things that regard humanity.You know when reviewing this type of film I really don't know where to start. Technically the movie is excellence at its best, the production design and art direction isn't simply beautiful it is plain out stunning. If Nathan Crowley doesn't win the Oscar this year I will be majorly upset. The design and look of every single element of the movie is surprising and unexpected too. The androids in the movie were some of the best I have ever seen, I'm ready to call them as good as R2-D2 and C3P0. You know, I was kind of disappointed when I heard Wally Pfister wan't DP on this movie, but after seeing it I can't believe to be saying that I'm kind of happy he wasn't. The visual spectacle of this movie is unlike anything I ever saw before on a screen. That is to be literally interpreted. I have no idea where CGI was. There isn't really a way to describe the visual experiences I had with the movie. Everything is flawless and it is so stunning and beautiful, my mouth was open probably 90% of the movie's length, you are taken to places that you never even imagined and they are so immersive so perfect. I really can't understand how a Director would start thinking of doing such sequences. When you add the whole emotional and philosophical core of the movie, that I will rave about later, to this visual splendor you have 169 minutes of physical emotion. I was genuinely aghast for the whole duration. My body was hot, I had constantly goosebumps, my muscles got stiff. This experience is so moving that when the movie ended I stayed up until the whole credits because I had to get the control of my body back, and I'm not exaggerating. I probably changed position just once during the movie because I was so frozen to my seat.Nolan is a master director and has now beaten down Hitchcock and Chaplain for me. I just don't know how he could think he could keep this together but he does. Everything is so solidly perfect, every single aspect is flawless. The script is tightly written and has riveting dialogue. Moreover, nothing, not a single element doesn't fit, everything totally makes sense and culminates in a breathtaking ending that lives up to the endings of all of the other Nolan movies. Every twist and turn it takes is surprising and jawdropping and it gets you closer and closer to characters that I really cared about and felt a genuine emotional connection to. I also have to note that this film had some very surprising humor, but most of all I felt a slightly different Nolan directing it, a more tenderhearted and sweat touch was added to this one that wasn't really present in any of his movies before. This movie has some of the best casting I have ever seen. I loved the casting of Wes Bentely, Jessica Chastain John Lithgow and others. It was so perfectly seamless. McConaghey and Hathaway give A++ performances and they both managed to movie me to tears in some of their moments. And not to forget, dear Hans, you did it again. No idea how Zimmer always delivers so highly, but he does. The score is the best he has done yet for Nolan, yes even better than Inception.I also love the message this movie has. There isn't just one obviously, The ideas touched are multiple, but they are all so interesting. What this movie has to say about love hit me like a train and I am still thinking about it. I have to get my head around everything yet but I'm sure that when I will do I will have long showers to do and to think in. EDIT: After seeing the movie many times I have now wrapped my head around it and I can safely say that alongside ""Amrican Beauty"" it is the movie that most expresses almost literally what I believe in and what are my ideas about life. Is there something wrong with the movie? EDIT: When I originally reviewd the film I thought there was something wrong with it: minor storytelling shortcuts that didn't make the overall product perfect. But after seeing the film five times in cinema and once on blu-ray, and having studied it like probably nobody else, I have come to the conclusion that this film is actually flawless. The storytelling shortcuts aren't there when you actually look closely. This movie is the best of the year obviously. Mr.Nolan thanks for everything you have done for cinema and every minute of enjoyment you have graced us with, you are a reason I am happy to be alive.",Interstellar
271,markgorman,Sci fi for the human race. supremely epic. A love poem to the human race.,9/10,1 December 2014,"Well, Interstellar has met with a mixed reception from the critics, but not the paying viewers who are currently rating it #13 of all time on IMDb.I'm with the people.And I find it hard to understand why the critics have been so lukewarm. Yes, it's a movie about the entire human condition and saving the human race (which inevitably brings it into some potentially pretentious territory - it doesn't escape Scot free in that respect) but Christopher Nolan doesn't let that get in the way of a good story, carefully handled special effects, some tremendous casting (the young Jessica Chastain as Murphy is just SPECTACULAR and inspired), great acting (Hathaway and McConaughey really do pull it off - again).Christopher Nolan seems to be maturing rather well.I've seen most of his films and some tend to over-elaborate in the FX department. Not this. When he needs a big canvas, like the icy landscape of a potential planet for the human race to inhabit (in a far off galaxy reachable via a galaxian wormhole) he delivers it in spades. But it feels believable.I like Sci-fi that has a heart, like The Handmaids Tale, and this sure does, partly because of its big themes - the Earth is about to die because of global warming for a start - this grounds the movie and it effortlessly cuts between dystopian Earth and not much better alternatives far, far away.The crop burning and the dust storms that ravage the (earth) screen are biblical in their fury. The end of the world truly is nigh. But the alternative seems either worse or sort of non- existent for most of the movie.What binds it though is the remarkable relationship between McConaughey's character as the father of Murphy (Jessica Chastain) and her aforementioned younger self, played by Mackenzie Foy - the likeness is remarkable.When Nolan finally goes all Matrix/Inception (as he must) he does it amazingly, in a way that makes the whole movie; theory of relativity, gravity and time continuums, and all come together like a slo-mo implosion. It's awesome (sorry for using that word, but it's appropriate).Now: a postscript. This is a peaen to 2001: A Space Odyssey. We have many nods in deference to the almighty Kubrick in this movie. Not one of them any more than a doffing of the cap to one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived and I, for one, respect Nolan for that.This is surely Nolan's greatest movie and at 2hrs 47 mins it felt like a short.Bravo.(A final word. Hans Zimmer rocks in this movie. An outstanding soundtrack that will surely pick up yet another Oscar.)",Interstellar
272,scottshak_111,Enter-a-stellar feat!,10/10,9 November 2014,"Not long ago, I watched a featurette with excerpts from the movie Interstellar, which showed the gargantuan amount of work and sweat Nolan brethren, Kip Thorne and others put in whilst exploring the behaviour of a black hole. The crisp attention and the minute details they did not overlook flabbergasted me beyond limit. So hopeful was written all over my head. And Nolan never disappoints.Strewn with science, this movie not only takes you on a joy ride, it educates you as well. The concept of space-time singularity pervades throughout the flick as we witness a superb simulation of a black hole, and it doesn't stop at just that. We go into it. Yes, through the eyes of our protagonist for the first time, we witness a distinct theoretical world that has found pragmatism. An impeccable representation of Tesseract with threads of time. The best thing about Nolan is the enormity of the project he takes. The script is so beautifully written that it rivets you right from the start. The concept is like magic, a miracle happening in a distant galaxy. As the story unfolds it makes you feel as if you are getting closer to finding answers to our existence finally. The plot however has something else in store for you. And it is a big fat blunt satire on our loneliness. We are alone and all we have is each other. That is the penultimate truth.Wormhole was never explored like this before. How time plays tricks on you, powerful representation of anomalies, the wickedness of human mind when left alone in despair(that #Damon bit), how the music of nature (the rain, the thunder and the cricket chirping noise) makes you feel home, the conundrum of our purpose, the humour of TARS, the physics that touches almost every part in the flick, the poetry of the brave and wise through Dylan Thomas's words, superb lamenting conversations, and the brain-wrecking revelations in the end - every little detail has been exemplified with proper logical explanations and shown on a platter of sensations.Emotional surge is strong, and with a power pack performance by McConnaughey everything uplifts. Bits of a father-daughter melodrama are the most feeling kind. Shatters you from the inside, as you empathize with the protagonist's tears. Zimmer touches your heart with his profound score. Notes are so brilliant that they put you right into the flick. This too would sit amongst Zimmer's best works.It is one of the most ambitious projects that would be remembered in impending debates for the intricacies it touches and the science it explores. Nolan is certainly one of a kind director, a great gift to mankind, a wise man who wouldn't go gentle into that good night. Kudos to yet another mammoth achievement!",Interstellar

274,kgprophet,Downbeat Predicaments Drag this Overly-Complicated Epic,6/10,29 November 2014,"This film is has so many subplots it should have been a mini-series. Over-reaching in ambition, there are too many complications dropped in to allow you to settle down and just enjoy the wonder of space. With so many elements to this extravaganza, there are 3 hours worth of story to trudge through. I go on and on about the 2 hour rule, the amount of time an audience is willing to sit before they get fidgety. But certainly I think a movie can go into overtime if it justifies it. Interstellar does not. What started losing me was the numerous themes the film was trying to juggle, and kept throwing at us to provide momentum through the long long running time.What would have justified the running time were longer moments of enjoying the ride. Less moments of just how depressed everyone is. Giving characters something to live for is necessary, but the sentimentality goes too far when we need a spark in the screenplay instead. This includes a downbeat revelation about the main storyline that cheats not only the main characters, but the audience as well, who both have invested a great deal of time this far into the story. Nolan decides to delve into psychology and about why people lie. That is one of the many themes that should have stayed out of this screenplay.With some dumb moments where odd things happen in the first act, you immediately go ""well OK, that doesn't make sense now, but obviously it will be about something in the third act"". But when they do return, it doesn't resonate like the screenplay wants to. Worse, the final resolution comes through such an absolute ridiculous metaphysical macguffin, that it feels glossed over because of the implausibility. Ands that's in a film that acknowledges a lot of ""hey this is science fiction"" type of implausibilities.As a big event film, it certainly delivers. The trip through the wormhole is thrilling. Moments of danger in the cockpit are well executed. Matthew McConaughey has plenty of personality to carry a film of this size. But he gets dragged down by his resentful daughter. The entire film has too much sad and angry moments. McConaughey is only in his element when he displays his heroism, something sadly lacking in a film about mankind's survival.",Interstellar

277,tankace,Your Space Odyssey,9/10,15 March 2016,"Interstellar is the most scientifically accurate movie I have ever seen, here as usually Nolan create an incredible film about the way we use science to go forward end combined with the determination as a specie to survive really send us to places we can't even imagine.Everyone plays their role perfectly and although you may don't understand fully the science ,you more than you get the fears ,hopes and that times desperation which our protagonist have deal with during their adventure in the star. Do not hear the people who try to find problems in the movie in order to make believe that it is rubbish, because it isn't firstly and secondary every film ever made has a issue or two but the good ones can overshadow them and be remembered funnily and Interstellar is in this category no doubt about that.

278,OttoVonB,A Flawed But Awe-Inspiring Film,8/10,19 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan and CO have done it again: this is undoubtedly the event movie of the year. Hyped, magnificent to behold, brazen, emotional and filled with ideas. For all that though, and despite its many qualities, it is closer to The Dark Knight Rises than it is to Inception.First, the good, and - lucky us - that means ""great"": McConnaughy effortlessly anchors this sprawling cosmic story and makes you care every inch of the way, without being too perfect a hero. Visually this is often a feast without being suffocating, due in no small part to a very clever camera-anchoring aesthetic which makes the space scenes both breathtaking and believable. You believe you are watching NASA footage of the future. Special mention to Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway, whose characters might have come across as silly caricatures in lesser hands. Emotionally too, this is an often touching, sometimes heartbreaking film.What really seems to strike a cord with audiences around the world, is how the film tackles the mind-bending issues of relativity and our insignificance as a species, while never losing track of its emotional core. To its credit it chooses to focus very intently on the idea that what is best for an individual and what is best for a species as a whole can be very strongly opposed. The film harks back to 2001 and Solaris (two very different films) in some of the ideas it addresses, but manages to have more humanity than the former, and more scope than the latter. In fact, in warning us of our folly and celebrating our ingenuity in times of desperation, it manages to have its cake and eat it to. No mean feat, and all the more satisfying an experience for it.Now, for the bad, and perhaps this takes multiple viewings to sink in: cleverly crafted as the film is, this comes more as an afterthought. If one chooses to scratch a bit beneath the surface, there are glaring plot and logic holes (one involving an obviously doomed choice of planet, the other a classic chicken/egg time travel paradox which is unfortunately central to the plot). You could look past these and even explain them away, but they could easily have been addressed, as well as one or two incredibly stupid things Nolan makes his characters say and do. Hans Zimmer's score is also at times overbearing and awkwardly loud in the mix, making one wonder what this could have been in the hands of someone like James Newton Howard or even Philip Glass.Anyone who has read Yukinobu Hoshino's peerless ""2001 Nights"" manga will have already seen many of the same ideas and settings explored better elsewhere, and perhaps that is partially the point, to fan the flame of curiosity, and get people to seek such sources out. A blockbuster that can make you both alarmed and proud as a species, while making you thirst for more about quantum physics, cosmology and the possibility of space travel deserves every accolade it gets.This is not the flawless masterpiece many would have you believe, but it touches brilliance more than once, and its rewards are immense. As an event movie, particularly in an age of dull sequels, this is so much more than we could hope for!",Interstellar
279,Danny_G13,"It's not his best, but it's still stunning",10/10,26 September 2015,"Many people will claim to be 'Christopher Nolan's biggest fan', so I'll add myself to that list as a huge admirer of his work, and to the group that can't actually believe he hasn't won an Oscar.Consequently my hopes are always sky high when it comes to his latest movie, and when it came to Inception, while it took two views, my hopes turned out conservative.But we're here for Interstellar. When it emerged Nolan's next picture was to essentially turn his attention to space my trust was implicit in him that it would be something special - and those hopes were realised, but I will concede he has done even more special work than this.Interstellar sees McConaughy's retired naval pilot Coop trapped in a borderline post-apocalyptic earth of the near future where dust and blight are basically killing all crops and mankind with them. The only way to save man is to find a new home, and Michael Caine's Professor Brand has a plan to achieve that, but it will require Coop to abandon his family (including beloved daughter Murph) for an indeterminate period while the plan goes into action.So just how good is Interstellar? Plot wise it's another which requires a couple of views to get the most out of it, and while you will feel much more satisfied on that second viewing, there will remain questions which come as a result of the topic - space, time travel and quantum mechanics are astounding topics to take on in cinema, and Nolan would never have been able to cover them all flawlessly. It's a fantastically compelling story, which has created a massive world of intrigue within itself - philosophical questions will abound for months, years afterwards, and those little plot holes probably only add to that.Directorally I would concede it is not his best piece of work - some aspects here are a little muddled and not overly clear - such a convoluted storyline was impossible to smooth over completely - but cinematography-wise it's by far his best. Some of the cascading views you will see here, in conjuction with the truly staggering special effects/CGI (the black hole and tsunamis are simply gorgeous), are mesmerising and probably the best ever seen in cinema.It is a slight pity, in terms of plot, that while it's well known Nolan made this his most personal and emotional film yet, the themes of love don't truly convince in the way they're delivered. A monologue Anne Hathaway's Brand gives reeks of Nolan's own opinion desperate to find a place for itself in this story, and it doesn't work.But the soundtrack does - very different to Inception, and no less epic, haunting or beautiful, even if the same riffs and melodies tend to be reused a lot.The acting? McConaughy's muddy Texan accent still struggles to make sense - same trouble with True Detective, but that aside it's entirely flawless from the entire cast.And lastly the ending. Some will not be happy with it - my issue with it was how abruptly it was delivered, and how the mild flaws in overall direction led to it not being as coherent as it could have.Overall it is still a 10/10 - Nolan is judged in different ways to mere mortal directors, and the only one of his films I haven't got as 10/10 is Insomnia, itself a remake. But it's the weakest of his non-Batman movies.Still outstanding though.",Interstellar

281,dr_clarke_2,"A film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish",10/10,1 February 2021,"Having dabbled with earth-bound science fiction in The Prestige and Inception, 2014's Interstellar saw director Christopher Nolan turn his hand to space-opera. Set in a not-too-distant future in which mankind's crops are failing, the film sees a group of astronauts headed by Matthew McConaughey's Cooper set out through a wormhole in search of a new planet for humanity to colonise. Naturally, they face difficulties, but not of the aliens and space-battle kind; Interstellar provides it characters with more scientifically plausible threats.
As well as directing Interstellar, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan, and it's a characteristically cerebral affair. This is science fiction that had a theoretical physicist as a scientific advisor and the challenges it presents include the effects of relativity, as Cooper's likelihood of ever seeing his children again grows ever more remote, and the gravitational forces of black holes. The story's scale is broad and deep, and is weighty not just in scientific terms, but also philosophical ones, the script musing extensively on the nature and power of love. At the same time, the first part of the film - set in an entirely recognisable near-future American dust-bowl - grounds the film in reality, and by taking the time to explore Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murphy it also provides it with an emotional heart. The film isn't entirely bereft of action however, thanks to the treachery of Matt Damon's Mann, a scientist who realises that his own survival matters to him more than that of mankind's.
The film unfolds relatively sedately over two and three quarter hours, but rather like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is a film so visually beautiful that it's easy to just sit and drink in the spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and so are the sets. There's an internal consistency to the design of the technology that is speaks of great attention to detail, and the novel blocky design of TARS and CASE is ingenious. The film marks cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's first collaboration with Nolan and he does a superb job, not just of the outer space sequences, but also during the location filming, which makes effective use of the panoramic vistas of the Canadian landscape the scenes were shot in to create an impression of a sickly, ailing world. Innovative use of hand-held cameras also helps to emphasise the claustrophobia of the space ship sets and nauseating dizziness of zero gravity. The astonishing visual are complemented by the soundtrack provided by regular Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, which perfectly captures the dramatic but often melancholy atmosphere of the story.
The casting of Matthew McConaughey as Cooper proves to be a masterstroke, as he gives an astonishingly naturalistic and at times emotionally charged performance, especially during Cooper's scenes with Murphy. He leads an impressive cast for an impressive film, and everyone is perfectly suited to his or her role, including Anne Hathaway as Amelia Brand, Matt Damon as the treacherous Mann, and Jessica Chastain as Murphy. Smaller roles are taken by the likes of John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley and Casey Affleck, and they all get under their characters' skins. This being a Christopher Nolan film, Michael Caine also appears, as aging scientist Professor Brand, and he brings quiet dignity to the character.
For all of the film's scientific credentials, Interstellar isn't a documentary: the film's lengthy denouement inside the tesseract takes the story into the realms of pure fantasy, and results in a fairytale happy ending that somehow manages to compliment the theoretical physics of the middle section. There's no reason why it shouldn't: it's an approach that worked for Stanley Kubrick and whilst inviting comparison (even unintentionally) to 2001: A Space Odyssey is asking for trouble, Interstellar compares well. It is a film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish; Christopher Nolan has yet to make a bad film, but it seems distinctly possibly that this one will come to be regarded as his best.",Interstellar
282,shawneofthedead,A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.,7/10,7 November 2014,"Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.",Interstellar
283,jawneyfloros,a hope for man kind,10/10,19 November 2018,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that there could be possibilities for humanity in space. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

284,inframan,I resent this film,1/10,12 December 2015,"I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences.Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie ""homages"" to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers. You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar. In summary the sheer numbing dullness & stupidity of Interstellar (& its concomitant popularity) managed to knock me into the worst state of depression I've experienced from a movie in years.",Interstellar
285,Puroo,Could have easily been Nolan's best movie,7/10,21 April 2021,"As someone who has always had interest in outer space as a kid, I always wanted a movie about space where unnecessary alien invasions and their civilisations are not shown. And with Interstellar my that dream definitely did come true, though not as much as I was hoping it to be. There are many things in this movie that I didn't understand, and the cosmic concepts are definitely not one of them.So first of all, this movie is taking place in a dystopian future. If I didn't know better I'd think that it's happening in an alternate reality. There was no mention of this being in the future at any point in the beginning. The only way to know about things was by people's talking, and I will explain later why it was a terrible decision.So everything about humanity is on a path of destruction and thus they choose to find a wormhole through which they can go to another planet and live over there, which is something I completely agree with. I'm the kind of a person who completely supports humanity to settle in space and letting nature and wildlife live on Earth in peace. But why are they going as far as another planet? Can't they just live on Mars or Titan? They looked way safer than the water planet they went to. The excuse that Mars and Titan don't have oxygen won't work because neither did this planet. And it was shown very well in the fight scene.Speaking of the fight scene, it was completely unnecessary. This is a movie about interdimensional space travel. No one is interested in petty conflicts. Already we are tensed about the crew not making it back to Earth and Cooper's daughter ageing and never getting to know whether her father is alright or not. I was feeling very bad for her. She didn't even take the opportunity to say goodbye to her father and now she has to regret about this for her whole life. On the other hand Cooper is also very tensed about not getting to see her daughter before she grows old and dies.My favourite part in the entire movie was when he reached the fifth dimension. He could see his daughter from the day he left her. While floating behind a bookshelf he tried his best to make her understand that he wanted to see her. And finally after long he decided to use the Morse code from the watch to make her understand. I was really empathising with him. I was feeling how I'd behave in a situation like this, where someone I have to contact does not even know Morse code and there is no way I could talk to them. Finally in the end we get to see the awesome world that the scientists make, where the gravity gets inverted and people can live in a much bigger place. It was a terrific idea. I wasn't even expecting the movie to end like that.And now like I said, I'll talk about the audio quality. The voice is so low and the score is so high it's very hard to listen to all the exposition that is given. Normally I'd not have any problem with that, but out of almost 3 hours of this movie, 2 hours is just talking, talking and more talking. I'm not able to read subtitles very fast so I couldn't keep track of what was going on. In fact, when TARS was speaking I didn't even know it was him. I used to think it's someone else in the background on whom the camera has not been shown. Since the volume was so low, it wasn't even possible to understand that these were different voices. And speaking of TARS, he was the most forgettable character in the movie. To write this review I had to watch Honest Trailers to remember everything, and then I remembered that TARS was even a thing.Interstellar is a masterpiece we can only expect Christopher Nolan to make. If anyone else had made a movie about outer space, they'd have definitely added aliens, like fishes on the new planet, or some rabbits hiding in their burrows. But I'm really glad that didn't happen, because that would have meant humanity didn't learn from its past mistakes and are choosing to start life on someone else's land. If it weren't for the long low volume talking and the forced exposition meant for uninformed audience, it'd have easily been my favourite Nolan movie.",Interstellar
286,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,"You may feel like a rat that's built its nest in a huge pipe organ, but",7/10,5 October 2015,"My wife, no sci-fi fan, expressed an interest in this almost-three-hour ""2001"" wannabe b/c the physicist who came up with the original story idea, Kip Thorne, was a colleague of her dad's at CalTech. Good to know that the (quantum) mechanics of the plot are in accordance with current thinking, but the best scenes are the early ones, while we're still trying to figure out what's going on in this dys-something world, where an ex–hotshot pilot is growing corn with the help of a smart combine and today's Internet craziness (the Apollo landing was faked!) is the received wisdom of the future. Later on, the Nolans come up with some nice relativistic plot twists—Anne Hathaway's dawdling for a few minutes on a high-gravity planet sets their schedule back by twenty-two years, Earth time—and the storyline is always intriguing, but not really all that involving, at least till the final scenes. The basic problem, IMHO, is too much sci and not enough fi; one of the main reasons that ""2001"" is still the gold standard is that Clarke and Kubrick don't try to explain away the mystery.The A-listers in the cast all do fine; Mackenzie Foy as the 10-yr-old Murph is perfect, though I was sorry that Bill Irwin (TARS the robot) was just doing a voice-over. Hans Zimmer's score may make you feel at times like a rat that's built its nest in a huge pipe organ, but it's also quite effective toward the end, when McConaughey's character reconnects with his estranged daughter from the depths of a black hole. In short, ""2001"" it's not, but, despite a few scenes where time seems to come to a standstill (the frozen Matt Damon planet, e.g.), ""Interstellar"" is still pretty entertaining and occasionally thought provoking as well",Interstellar
287,Hunky Stud,"weak storyline, this film is over-rated.",6/10,14 February 2016,"i was expecting to see an exciting sci-fi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating, but it was a disappointment. it has several problems in no particular order.1. the robot's design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon, shouldn't the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesn't even have two hands. it can't really do anything other than talking. 2. the robot's voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money, so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap.3. cooper the character didn't do anything scientific, all of sudden, he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didn't make sense.4. lack of asians. in 2016, black people are protesting lack of ""diversity"" in Oscar, this film didn't have any Asian faces in it. there are more Asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire Asian actors.",Interstellar
288,zeekwunlau,The biggest enemy is actually human,9/10,6 April 2020,"Three hours is the limit of a movie's viewing time. Even if the plot is unsatisfactory, the audience nestled in the black box will be restless. ""Interstellar"" just less than 3 hours, is on the critical line to exercise patience of the audience. In the last half hour, utterly covering his heart with his hands in prayer, Matthew McConaughey went further into the sky, and took a step back to lose all. The moment when I got up from the theater seats and finally returned to the earth after getting out of the cabin, I was generally terrified. In the endless time and space, we feel thrilled and tormented, with the protagonist wandering between hope and despair, exhausted. I very much agree with what the author in ""The Odyssey of the Abyss"" said: ""The film contains a nesting metaphor for the film itself. From the ordinary life into the dark theater, and in the darkness through the screen to another life , And then in another life, suddenly embarked on a wonderful journey, layer by layer into the play and layer by layer, with the flow of people out of the theater, and not into the streets and turbulent In the vulgar. There are several layers of dreams, there are many galaxy. The high stars are not related to us, it seems that one day they will cover our daily life. ""Therefore, it can be said that"" Interstellar Crossing ""is a mass participation. In the movie, I ca n't understand the wormhole, why Matthew falls vertically from outer space and can fall into a ridiculous five-dimensional space, although there is no ability and knowledge to analyze this hard science fiction from a physical point of view, But it does not prevent us from sitting on the seats of the movie theater for a long time, and using our own way to explain and understand. I 'm glad that Nolan played the finale of a magic stick without disappointment: the ""them"" who inspired the exploration all the way is us, we are the ""them"", and there are infinitely fragmented pieces in her daughter Murphy 's bookshelf In time, the father who regretted going to explore the universe returned to the point where the wrong decision occurred again and again to hint to himself. It's similar to the heroine who died several times in ""Terror Cruise"" but couldn't get out of the game. In this way, five-dimensional space is just a concept, not difficult to understand. I'm not a fan of Nolan, but in my own opinion, ""Interstellar"" is undoubtedly the biggest and most ironic movie in all his works and penetrates the topic of human nature. In the November file last year, I also watched ""Gravity"" in Daguangming. If we simply look at the theme of ""survival,"" the Nolan Brothers script would like to discuss the complexity of human nature and the mutual guidance of humanity in the collective subconscious reincarnation. The role is much more complicated than that of Sandra Bullock 's survival and jumping game; George Clooney faces the non-human suave and up-and-coming calm image of death in the vast universe, self-assured man in Matt Damon Dr. Eun looked vulnerable. There is almost no comparability in the text, but in terms of visual technology, there are exactly 80% gravity and 130% gravity Miller planet and hill planet, so that the actors do not have to float to perform, and it also saves a lot of later expenses. Rather than being played with by nature and the mysterious universe, looking at the biggest enemy in Interstellar from the surface is time, and then looking at the inner core, the biggest enemy is man himself. The universe is worn around, so innocent.",Interstellar
289,gavinp9,"A good sci-fi drama, but needed more action and adventure!",7/10,2 January 2018,"'Interstellar' was a film I'd been waiting to see all year, and it certainly is a huge sci-fi film - $165 million budget - from one of the best filmmakers going round. Basically, we spend 40min on Earth in the not-too-distant-future, where all the crops are failing and Homo sapiens are about to be wiped from the planet. Cooper (McConaughey), Romilly (Gyasi) & Dr Brand (Hathaway) are then sent to another galaxy - via a wormhole - as a last grasp attempt to find another habitable planet.The film does really well of asking those big picture themes - what's more important, family of the entire species, love or exploration, why do we matter? However, as a sci-fi/action film, it sometimes lets itself down - the characters aren't that well developed, beside Cooper & his two kids (Chastain & Affleck when they're older) and there's too much maths/physics/relativity and not enough excitement and wonder.Sure, the special effects you do get to see of the black hole and the planets they visit are great, but there's just not enough of them - it's a lot of them in a space suit/ship with an overbearing Hans Zimmer's score making it hard to hear actual dialogue. It's probably slightly longer than necessary also - 2 hours 50min, with the last 30min being a less-than-ideal conclusion to the film. Hopefully Damon playing an astronaut prepares him for next year's 'The Martian', which should be more exciting than 'Interstellar'.Nolan - who will arguably one day go down as a directorial legend like Kubrick - owes a lot to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and essentially 'Interstellar' doesn't do anything better than that film 46 years ago. But it's not all bad - I think my expectations were too high, especially after 'Gravity' last year - with Caine & Lithgow being solid on Earth and the robots, TARS & CASE (very similar voices/roles to HAL in '2001' & GERTY in 'Moon') providing some humour (and a very unique form/function!).",Interstellar
290,TheMarwood,"Isn't always successful, but there's enough quality filmmaking on display to recommend",6/10,7 December 2014,"There are some undeniably striking images in Interstellar, but far to often they are accompanied by silly grandiose dialogue and there's some questionable plotting throughout - the film definitely bites off more than it can chew, but there's enough good filmmaking and spectacle on display to get through the bumps along the way. Once in space, our leads have a few planets to explore to see if they are hospitable for human colonization and due to questionable plotting, the first planet they choose is the most threatening to their mission. Each hour on the planet is about 7 years on earth and of course, this is presented as a dramatic narrative countdown clock device and human stupidity all but ensures something will go wrong. Anne Hathaway's character foolishly wonders out in search of data until it is too late and finally a robot is sent after her and grabs her in seconds. Why the robot wasn't sent out to begin with so they don't burn time is a lazy ploy to up the dramatic stakes. This is soon followed by a dialogue exchange of what planet to explore next and Hathaway's love is on one planet, so naturally they decide to explore the other. With these people out to save mankind, it's amazing they made it past the moon without compromising the mission. What follows, should be left to the viewer to discover without giving away anything. However, the last act is a very watchable mess - a bizarre mix of sentiment and odd imagery that doesn't work. Interstellar isn't the most successful film, but it commands your attention throughout its long running time.",Interstellar
291,GeorgeRoots,"Part Of Me Thinks My Love For ""Interstellar"" May Deepen Over Time..",7/10,10 November 2014,"Hopefully when you're reading this, you'll have seen the movie and tried to take in all of Interstellar's extremely ambitious U-turns and stunning visuals. By the time the credits role, there was lot left to be desired. But how jaw dropping a final act it was, that I'm glad Christopher Nolan decided to try and reach for the stars, then not try at all. Immediately I thought back to the first trailer in December 2013, where the use of stock footage, Hans Zimmer, Matthew McConaughey's voice and the tag-line ""One Year From Now"" was all I needed to peak my interest. Of course our interests were fuelled all the more, when they started to show planets and locations in further trailers closer to the films release. Personally I wish they held back a little in marketing, just because that would have had so much more of an impact whilst viewing the movie.In the ""near"" future, Earth is no longer sustainable to humanity. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot turned framer, reluctantly joins a team of space travellers, who plan to travel through a newly discovered wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. His plans to go on this quest pretty much destroys his relationship with his children, for which making amends is the only driving force for Cooper to return home. As he and the crew bravely venture above and beyond what they could've imagined.In terms of visuals, the movie is 10/10 gorgeous. It can easily be Christopher Nolan's best looking movie, and the fact that all of it is practical sets and locations like Iceland etc. Cannot help but leave a deep impression. Again, the ambitious nature of this production overall will inevitably lead to some stellar cinematography, but every time we were aboard the main ship (The ""Endurance"") I just wanted to reach out and touch a dashboard or study the cryogenic beds. Special effects are scarce, yet the ones created are actual visual representations from algorithms by Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who was also the executive producer. There's a plethora of connections to be made instantly with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), but frankly I just wanted to mention the homages to the ""Monolith"", in the form of the two on-board robots who shined in their ""resourcefulness"".But onto the narrative, which is where ""Interstellar"" seems to dip and dive. Ultimately the journey became wonderfully whole, and a certain story arc that infuriated me in the beginning lessened it's grip overall. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan love to introduce a recurring theme of ""meta-fictive"" narration in their films, and all of this is present in a stellar filmography that has definitely found an audience. ""Interstellar"" has this feat, yet the primary focus of the piece seems to be ""Love"". The love Cooper has to want to get back to his kids is identifiable, if not cliché and shamelessly forced in some emotional moments. But there's a scene when Anne Hathaway's character is explaining the scientists concept that love transcends time and space, it really took me out of the moment as I waited for the following scene to appear. In short, love is magic and hasn't that been done to death?Hans Zimmer teams up with Christopher Nolan again to compose the music. Though the use of a certain song is used repetitiously throughout, it's another fantastic score we've come to expect from Zimmer and I'm still waiting to hear the remainder of the soundtrack. There are moments where the dialogue and music are at the same pitch, which becomes harder to hear and it usually happens when something extremely loud is happening in the scene. It can become infuriating when trying to hear what they say, even more so when the movie can become quiet in an instant and replicate dialogue straight from actual astronaut footage to brilliant effect. There are music cues that easily spoil the build up when someone does something out of character (What movie isn't guilty of that?), but a lot of the movie shows the musical restraint that Nolan executes particularly well.And lastly, I want to say that every actor was superb. For all you have heard me attack certain moments of the script, and how some of the characters and scenarios have been delivered. I can confidently say there is not one weak link in this entire star-studded cast. Matthew McConaughey is just getting better and better with each role, and he really is the heart and driving force of the movie. John Lithgow, Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, A surprise cameo from a certain A-list talent and Michael Caine all wonderfully bounce off each other and make it ""effortless"". Lastly the child acting was very strong, and Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck blend into their characters seamlessly.Final Verdict: Visually stunning, though I consider ""Interstellar"" to have some minor flaws. It's concept, ideology and results are nothing more than what I would expect from a Christopher Nolan film, and I'm so happy he went above and beyond regardless of those few minor flaws. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and as always, I thoroughly look forward to Nolan's future outcomes. 8.5/10.",Interstellar

It is stupid and shallow. Rustin Cohle and Jason Bourne in the same movie yet they are given stupid lines to say. What an absolute bad movie. Movies like this are really a horrible warning of the horrible and terrible times we live in where insane nonsense rubbish like that is considered quality. What is wrong with Christopher Nolan? Memento is a great movie. The first Batman pretty cool (best Batman movie) although a bit shallow perhaps (vague existentialism like ""my actions define me""). Other Batman movies not very good. Inception interesting but ultimately failing and Interstellar interesting but ultimately failing. What kind of audience seriously want to see shitty like that? Compare with my generation who grew up with intelligent and suave sci-fi like 2001 and Blade Runner. And the anti-natalist Rustin Cohle is virtually ridiculed by now playing a stupid natalist. Interstellar is quite simply rubbish. It is trash. It reeks of stupidity and failure.",Interstellar
294,bix171,Of A Piece,10/10,14 November 2015,"As was apparent from his previous film, ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Christopher Nolan has become the preeminent hack in Hollywood--and that's meant as a compliment. Nolan is a committed romantic: the only difference between him and, say, William Wyler, is that Nolan dresses up his love stories with astonishing visual effects and complex plots with a heavy emphasis on spiritualism. ""Interstellar"" is Nolan's most accomplished work yet, with a far more satisfying mise en scene than his previous non-Batman work, the tedious and frustrating ""Inception"", and he finds a more effective means to discuss what is fast becoming his major theme: time's effect on relationships, from the largest (all humanity) to the smallest (families) and his aw-shucks notion of transcendent love is sweet and satisfying. Though there are no real standouts, Nolan gets good performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and, in supporting roles, Casey Affleck and Nolan stalwart Michael Caine; they're good but where Nolan is going for tearjerking tenderness, the actors don't quite deliver. Still, Nolan's script (written along with his brother, Jonathan) is beautifully written and thought-provoking and the mammoth but necessary effects (an homage to Kubrick, sharply filmed by Hoyte Van Hoytema) are as outsized as Nolan needs them to be. Everything feels of a piece here and, as in ""Inception"", you have to pay close attention. But this time it all flows together exquisitely.",Interstellar
295,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,5/10,18 February 2015,"I did read many reviews here before seen the film and from them and the average stars I thought it was going to be really good, but it was not. Though the story of the film is quite good and acting too, and plus I like those kind of movies, it just was kinda boring most of the time for me. I couldn't even watch it as a whole but I had to pause it because I was bored and then continued only because I do not like to do anything in half.Surely, it is better than Gravity in my opinion which is totally totally boring, since they are kinda similar. I was hesitant between 5 and 6, but 5 is more accurate for me. It is neither good neither bad - just boring.

Even more unfathomable is that the way this universe works, these laws of physics, appear to have been created especially for us. Humans are the only entities that can make sense of time - we age, we do things by spending time, we can feel it, and we can totally choose to ignore it while we sleep. Perhaps one day we might really make use of what has meaning only to us.Christopher Nolan is a genius.It is the kind of sci-fi that is heartrending, nerve-wracking, and will move you to tears.

298,Figgy66-915-598470,Awesome,10/10,8 November 2014,"8 November 2014 Fiona's Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Interstellar. This is definitely a thinking man's (or woman's) action film. Lots and lots of technical jargon which was fairly difficult to follow. Having said that, this long film, all 169 minutes of it had me rooted to my seat. With earth on the brink of extinction due to climate change, disease and drought, a group of people leave our planet on a secret mission to find previous space explorers who went searching for new planets to inhabit. Matthew McConaughey, and Anne Hathaway lead the cast and the expedition on a quest to save the world and there is another solid performance from Michael Caine. That all sounds terribly glamorous but in reality it's not, it is life changing, heart wrenching, and soul destroying to list a few, but hang in there, this tale does have an ending. Although at times the pace was a little slow, I felt it was necessary to match the speed of the story, and the passing of years. A stupendous score by the great Hans Zimmer, accompanied by an amazing collection of sound effects without which the film would not work, this piece of movie-making by Director Christopher Nolan is a must watch.

299,eberkerbatur,one of the best movies in the history of cinema (9.6),10/10,31 January 2021,"A great movie that I watched many times, should definitely be among the best movies of all time. It is one of the five best films for me.
It's really hard to understand Nolan's mind and I watched the movie with my mouth open.It's amazing to convey space, planets, gravity, everything like this. There is a lot of emotion in the science fiction movie, and you definitely cry at the end of the movie. Simply awesome.

300,kermitkid,"Nolan's latest film is quite ""Stellar""",10/10,30 March 2020,"If this film isn't nominated for some awards at the Oscars, there's something wrong with the Academy. This is one of the best films of 2014, and it definitely deserves more than 73% fresh. That's too low of a score. I'd say it's more around the 90-95% range. It's an absolutely amazing film. Pardon the pun, but I'd even go so far as to say this movie is...wait for it...stellar. This is what ""Gravity"" should have been. It's a very thought provoking film and needs to be at least nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards. There are some issues with sound mixing where the sound muffles the dialogue sometimes, but according to Christopher Nolan, this was intentional. Don't wait for Blu-ray. See it while it's still in theaters! Your stomach will rumble when the ships take off, and you will be amazed at the visual effects. This film has plenty of heart, humor, and an intriguing plot that will make you forget it has a 3-hour runtime. It feels more like 2 hours.
Grade: A+ 10/10, 5/5 stars.

301,Rendanlovell,3rd act is the only bad in this movie.,7/10,7 November 2014,"Interstellar is not Christopher Nolans best. But I got to say It's pretty close. It opens on Cooper played Matthew McConaughey a farmer with living with his 2 kids and his dad. We learn very quickly that the world is in a state of decay. And that the planet is running low on food. The not so distance future ideas purposed here are very interesting. But as interesting as it is the movie doesn't stay on earth for very long. After 30-40 minutes the movie journeys into the blackness of space. And this is were the fun really beings. You can feel Chris Nolans attention to detail as you awe at super massive black holes or reality bending wormholes. Interstellar is not just a movie, its an experience. One that you should have in theaters. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. This is film really does push the limits of visual FX. Reportedly having to design completely new software to mathematically get all the visuals correct. Not only are the VFX incredible but the sound is too. In fact it was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. It goes from deathly silent to blaringly loud numerous times. And that helped to sell the experience even more. Oh and the soundtrack by Hans zimmer is just amazing. Apparently Chris didn't even give him a movie script. He just said get rid of the drums and give me something fresh. And a beautiful, haunting score was the result. With all this amazingness, Nolan doesn't forget his characters. Well he forgets a few. But he wastes no time having his characters tell a emotional story. While the characters are pretty good the acting is only meh. There wasn't any standout performances from anyone. But it was hard to focus in the early hours of the movie because the guy next to me was playing with a piece of paper for like an hour!! But i did get to hear the last half of the film and unfortunately it stumbled around with the 3rd act. Here's how I would describe it. This part was super cool. And this part was super cool. But they didn't really add up. That left me confused and wanting an explanation but not getting one. Everything was explained with science throughout the movie then suddenly it wasn't. Overall Interstellar is a film you HAVE to see in theaters. It is Breathtaking to look at and incredible to listen too. The story is equally grand but cracks under it's own weight in the 3rd act.",Interstellar
302,mgd_m,A masterpiece with flaws that doesn't age well,6/10,10 October 2019,"While the story and the visuals are outstanding, at the third or fourth view I can better understand the flaws that I noticed from the start. After all, the plot is quite simple, and the dialogues are irritantingly obvious and full of exposition. So, once you get accustomed to the wow-moments, little remains aside some very good eye-candy. Nolan is clearly the most overvalued director of this time. He's a visionary, but not a good writer or director. At the end of the day, Interstellar is a masterpiece in his concept and will forever retain an history-making value, but it's not that good cinematographically speaking. 6.5 stars.

303,pkpera,"Review after second watch, 4 years later",7/10,21 October 2018,"High rated movie, expected with big hype in it's time, as it was (and is) usual with Christopher Nolan movies.
Indeed, it is visual masterpiece, with stellar casting, but I did not see much from title - Interstellar travel was marginalized, actually all it was some half minute wormhole crawling. Scientific part was marginal too, but that was to expect. Instead it, we has some high emotional family drama, combined with heavy 'time dilatation', fifth dimension again, combined with gravity. All it with some goal, but will not go into it to not spoil it.
Sad thing is that all it did not make much sense. There were spectacular shots, landscapes, but our heroes, at least scientist ones made mostly bad decisions. Exception was main character Cooper, just a pilot/engineer. Well, that's what people likes to see, I guess.
Worst part was last 10 minutes. Rushed after about 2.5 hours not always fast paced happenings.
The good: robot was cool.Now, I'm on very strong opinion that only right way is to take more care about our Planet and to keep it habitable, to make it better as is at moment - and that is possible - while interstellar travel is still wild fiction. Even travel to Mars is pretty much it, and just not option for transferring millions - even 5 is too much, really. Why so much movies about moving on places which are far worse than some desert or Antarctic ?",Interstellar
304,christian94,Nolan gets past his commercial boyish Batman phase to revert to his brilliant ways,9/10,8 November 2014,"Nolan gets it right again with an intelligent thoughtful, complex and profound sci-fi ode and odyssey.A robot more humorous than Hal and the hallmark of a Contact-esque quest for humanity outside of Earth. We have a multi-layered personal and planetary drama with all the dazzle, science, sociology and humanity needed to make it legendary.Not without it's flaws in tempo and in a few underwhelming scenes, it has enough gusto, philosophy, questions, twists, tension and tenderness to awaken all kind of feeling to most moviegoers and more.I had the chance to see it in IMAX at the release date and the visuals, sound and handsome music from Hans Zimmer carried the multi-sense tense experience throughout.The directing and editing made the running time seem instantaneous. Interstellar reveals quite a few interesting repercussions of our current scientific understanding of time and makes it relatable and perplexing. The story from the Nolan brothers have several narrative propellers and interesting intellectual revelations like Memento and Inception which Christopher wrote. It does however capture a better emotional, epic and grandiose dimension.Matthew McConaughey plays the lead role fresh from his Oscar win and I could not believe it had been 17 years since I was enthralled by him in theatre with the even better Contact (1997) which I even saw twice on the big screen and many times at home. It has been this long since Hollywood made such a good science-fiction self-contained movie... (it had been 29 years before that with the landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968))Hope I won't have to use the laws of relativity to see another one sooner...An overall satisfied, sensitive and surreal piece of cinematic history.",Interstellar
305,EvanKevelson,A Stellar achievement,7/10,9 January 2021,"If you know or can get a hold of theoretical physics, you'll love this movie.
I just think of some of the most thought provoking, entertaining, well written movies, and I wonder at what point did half of these necessitate depression?
Personally I thought the Matt Damon sequence in the context of the film was a form of ""Dark Comedy"".....Just from when they woke him up you knew he was clearly out of touch with reality....then the statistical probability of docking while rotating like a toddler with hyperactivity. Then flying through a black hole just in a space suit....anything that hit the emotional buttons was negated.
I did feel it was a bit stretched out.....and I would have preferred some expediency to get an idea of Our protagonist reconnects with Cat Woman like Adam and Eve of a new world...but that cliffhanger like Inception seems to be a staple.
Overall entertaining, and far better than ""The Martian"" and ""Ad Astra""....I'm just saying for depression and feeling hopeless about the self destructive behaviors of humankind, I can read the paper every day, I enjoy the thought provoking film....but if it's going to be 2:47 minutes don't depress me in the ""artistic"" process.
Being a science fiction person and having some familiarity with theoretical physics I appreciate the movie. If I saw it in an IMAX I may have boosted it up a star.
All that being said there were too many scenes where I said to myself....e.g. can we save Coop, and blow up Dr. Mann more expeditiously please? Can they just say where going to Mann not your ex boyfriend without a metaphysical philosophical discussion on love (which could equally apply to true hate)?
With the suspension of belief, the on and off good and bad writing, and amazing effects I'll give it a seven.",Interstellar
306,jb_campo,Thoughtful movie,8/10,4 September 2015,"Interstellar gets you thinking about lots of things, mostly those lost opportunities and the regrets you have from NOT doing what you wanted to when you could do it. In that vein, the bending of time that takes place throughout the movie gives you plenty of ways to be introspective, and maybe even have a second chance.Enter Matt Mcconaughy as the somewhat frustrated lead, Cooper, who is a farmer on a dying planet, instead of a jet pilot, which he is trained to do. He's raising two young kids on his own, Murph being the most visible, and actually a brilliant young mind. His son Tom seems more obedient and is ready to take over the household when Coop gets sent on a mission to save humanity. Professors Brand (father and daughter) are played by Michael Caine and Annie Hathaway, are terrific. The acting in general is strong. The movie is almost 3 hours long but it moves along quickly.Throughout the mission, you wonder if they will find the new planet, what is going on back on earth, what year is it back on earth (because gravity does some incredible warping and compressing of time it seems). You need to suspend reality as you watch this movie, and think, OK, well, that's cool.In the end, this movie neatly combines human emotions, hope, family, with technical wizardry and excellent storytelling to deliver a must-see movie that will inspire deep emotions in you. Enjoy.",Interstellar

308,squirrel_burst,"Unlike anything you've ever seen; bold, ambitious, mind-blowing",10/10,12 December 2014,"My passion for anything space travel made me fall instantly in love with ""Interstellar"", but there's a lot more to my recommendation of the film than just that. This is a profoundly ambitious movie, one that will make you think and that puts the ""science"" back in ""science fiction"". That's something to be excited about because the genre isn't just about alien robots that can turn into cars and mutant turtles that know martial arts, it's about the endless possibilities that might be within our reach. I'm getting ahead of myself though. You're wondering what this Christopher Nolan project is all about! Well, it's basically about a former NASA pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is enlisted to travel to space in order to find a new home for humanity. Sounds easy right? Not so much when you're venturing into an unknown galaxy through a wormhole, you have to deal with the drama of leaving your family behind for the good of humanity and you might just encounter the odd space anomaly like black holes while dealing with gravity and hypersleep.I have a lot of admiration for this movie. This is one complicated story, and it doesn't try to dumb itself down, ever. It's not so complicated that you can't follow it, but there's a lot of material here. I had heard ahead of time that extensive scientific consultation was provided to make the movie as accurate as possible, but you could easily draw this conclusion yourself just by seeing the film. The visuals here are amazing, like nothing you've ever seen before. Literally. This is as close as we're probably ever going to get to see the inside of a worm hole, a passage from our galaxy to a completely undiscovered universe , fully rendered in a realistic way. That should be enough, but that's just the tip of the iceberg here. We actually get to travel through the worm hole, experiencing the dizzying effects as these astronauts travel who knows how many light years away from home. What do they find on the other side? Strange sights and locations, each more dazzling than the last. The film is absolutely breathtaking when it is showing you what space travel is like. Do you remember how movies used to be about seeing wild locations and catching a glimpse at other cultures across the globe? That's pretty much disappeared now that we have the internet, but that feeling, that rush, is back with ""Interstellar"". It's like the most beautiful Hubble telescope photos you've ever seen, set to a brilliant score by Hans Zimmer (and I know that gets you excited as soon as you remember that thunderous ""Inception"" or ""Dark Knight"" theme), packed with strong performances and what felt to me like boundless imagination.Not only do we have the science fiction elements, with the space travel, the exploration of new worlds and all that this entails, but there's also a lot going on psychologically with this movie. Our main character is leaving Earth and his children behind for a mission that could take who knows how long. Not only does the family have to deal with the idea that they're going to be separated, maybe for years, but it gets even crazier. It's not like Cooper is going to come back to Earth and find that his children have simply grown up. This is space travel here. We've got hibernation sleep for the astronauts to consider, the fact that communication might be very limited and the biggest elephant in the room, the fact that because our astronauts are going to be traveling through space anomalies and at very high speed, the crew is going to be aging at a different rate than the people on Earth. Can you imagine if this mission went wrong and the astronauts got back to Earth, only to find that the world they were trying to save is already dead? Even if it wasn't that far, the odds are good that Cooper will never see his children again. That's not even considering the idea that his children might not WANT to see him again after he leaves the planet to go off exploring the stars. If you want a movie where the stakes are high, this movie is through the roof because it has both the intimate risk of the family crumbling apart and the chance that the entire world will perish.I wish all science fiction, wait; I wish all films were as visionary and as bold as this one. It feels like every single detail was carefully selected and scrutinized to make sure it complimented everything else in the film. Not only do we have sights the likes of which you've never seen before, but I found that the action sequences were also really inventive and even the design of this world had me blown away. The robots in this film, not only in their look, but in their ""personality"" are so awesome that you will never be able to forget them. I feel like there's no shortage of praise I could give this film, and yet there was often so much going on that I'm certain I didn't even notice some significant elements. I know that realistically, there are some dramatic moments that do falter a bit and that the movie might have been able to cut a few minutes here or there, but because of the absolute mind-blowing experience that I had seeing the film, and for the fact that the inspiration and the boldness of it all swept me off my feet, I can't help but give the movie a perfect score. I can't see any way that this isn't going to be on my ""best of the year"" list. I can't wait to watch it again.As for you, see it in Imax if you can. Now that is an experience you won't easily forget. (Theatrical version in Imax, December 4, 2014)",Interstellar
309,luke-a-mcgowan,"An overly ambitious, underwhelming sprawl, salvaged by a few nice bits",5/10,11 November 2014,"Interstellar represents Christopher Nolan exceeding his reach in his obsession with difficult, gamechanging films. What he achieved with Inception he has bungled here with a overlong narrative that alternates between confusing and lazy.At 2hrs 50, this movie goes on far too long, and I blame the film's ridiculous indulgence in unnecessary subplots. Who cares if Brand is in love with one of the missing scientists? Who cares if Cooper's grandson has a cough? None of it contributes to the film's main plot (which itself is hard to describe after all the nonsensical science jibber). No original screenplay should be as long as this film is.The script is very lazy in some sections - if something needs to be somewhere, or explode, or if a realisation needs to be had, it will happen, no matter whether it makes sense or not. At times, Nolan attempts to explain why it happened but his explanations often just muddy the waters. He indulges in far too many deus ex machina for one film, and the film's final act follows Edge of Tomorrow and Fury to be one of the sappiest and most predictable endings to ruin what was meant to be a sad moment.The acting is fairly good, though the tanned, drawling McConaughey is horrendously miscast as an intellectual astronaut (though he plays the loving father with far greater conviction). Michael Caine plays Michael Caine for the 6th Nolan film in a row, and despite being seen in scenes 23 years apart he looks exactly the same. At this point, Michael Caine needs to start demonstrating some range or be remembered as one of the weakest recipients of two Academy Awards in history. Matt Damon and Casey Affleck are very memorable in brief scenes, with well-defined and motivated characters. Anne Hathaway is the film's highlight, as the film's female lead, she is fully at home in a spacesuit and providing much of the film's emotion. Jessica Chastain and McKenzie Foy are both hauntingly effective as Murph, with Chastain in particular giving a very impressive and emotional turn.Soundwise, Interstellar plays one giant crescendo, but once your ears adjust its a rather nice score. Visually, I am disappointed to note that Interstellar brought absolutely nothing new to the table - everything they did had been done before or better in Inception, Gravity or even Apollo 13. The plants looked beautiful, but there is nothing groundbreaking about creating water or ice through CGI. The visuals of outer space were lazily constructed save for the black hole, which would have been forgivable if Gravity wasn't such a recent memory.However, at the end of the day there is something unshakeably beautiful or memorable about Interstellar, and that feeling is the only thing that keeps Interstellar in positive review territory. Ultimately, this film will become one of those ""I'm glad I saw it, but I won't watch it again"".",Interstellar
310,nicolechan916,Interesting story with intriguing plots and great acting.,8/10,11 November 2014,"First off, this would've been a lot better if they had cut quite a lot of the first half of the film. It took too long to get going and I was ready to fall asleep — it didn't help that I was already tired to begin with. The beginning set my mood for most of the film and maybe I was sitting too close to the screen, but my head felt really heavy.The plots were really intriguing and I love the concept of travelling light years in space with relativity and all that stuff. I'm not a physics geek myself but I have read previous Orson Scott Card novels and I think it was the Ender's Game series that had that space travel. Anyway, it was pretty easy to keep along with the time travel and wasn't as complicated as I thought it might be.The acting was brilliant. I personally do not like McConaughey all that much but he was pretty good in this, though I had a hard time understanding his accent at first. Hathaway was good in her role too, though not really a significant presence. What stole the show for me was Mackenzie Foy. Moving away from being Renesmee in Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2, her role here is completely different and she was able to get into her character's shoes really well. The emotions she was able to convey of her character was very mature for her age. Chastain as the older version of Murph played her character well too.In addition, the visual effects were stunning and visually stimulating. It's not easy to make outer space look real, and invent realistic looking worlds at the same time. The worm hole was well crafted and the layout of the planets carefully planned. What I do not get is the 5th dimension stuff, though I liked the visuals. I just don't understand how it got there.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Interstellar
311,bazookamouth-221-898097,Great movie but slow,8/10,19 October 2018,"Briliant movie. I think why many were confused watching the movie is that it works hard to give scientific basis for the actions taking place and even tries to make it simpler for the common folk to understand but we are simply not smart enough to follow along with every instance , we just have to kind of hang in there and take some big leaps to understand a lot of the movie. Its damn hard to follow at times. Dazzling visuals with pacing issues. Still great stuff.

312,trublu215,A visually epic film,6/10,3 November 2014,"Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.",Interstellar
313,theromanempire-1,Another Average sci-fi flick...................,5/10,21 November 2014,I had high hopes for this one but the only thing i really loved in the movie was the awesome....SOUNDTRACK.Unfortunately this had flaws in many parts of the plot and showed us things which were unrealistic in many ways and kinda boring.The movie had it's moments and if u are a sci-fi film fan then u can check it out but it's nothing special.2001 was much better poetry movie than this.The characters were predictable and the reasons why the professor did what he did were unrealistic and unreasonable.I will not spoil the movie but u have to wait for 3 hours before u get out of the theater.the movie is too long.Get the O.S.T And that's all u need to remember from that movie.,Interstellar
314,Quebec_Dragon,Short review for a long film,8/10,16 December 2014,"I'm glad I saw this in Imax as it was really worth seeing on the biggest screen possible. The epic story was well told and sometimes gripping. Cinematography was very good except for overuse of that one angle where you see the prow of the lander ship. Space vistas themselves could have been more impressive as it seems digital effects were intentionally limited. The surfaces of planets and phenomenas compensate. Excellent acting all-around with McConaughey the highlight, except he was sometimes hard to understand. The sound effect work and especially the stirring music were awesome. It was more emotional than Nolan's previous films, yet I didn't tear up. Your final appreciation will likely depend on what you think of the ending.

315,williampsamuel,"An ""Odessy"" for the 21st century",9/10,7 December 2014,"What can I possibly say to explain Interstellar? Perhaps I should begin by admitting I did not fully understand this movie, and you probably won't either. Honestly I doubt that Steven Hawking and Neil Tyson Degrassi really understand this movie. That's not because of plot holes or poor exposition but because it is based around concepts which are themselves mind bending. Here time dilation, gravitational anomalies, and super-massive black holes are just the beginning, leading up to paradoxes that make Doctor Who seem straightforward and understandings of time and space that we don't yet have the ability to comprehend. In other words there are things in this movie which are not explained because they simply cannot be.But that matters less than you would think. You'll probably understand the who and the why of the story even if you don't always understand the how. What is important to understand is that the earth is dying. Society is trying to rebuild itself after some unspecified cataclysm, but world population is dangerously low, the farm belt is In the midst of another dust bowl, and though few realize it yet our crops are on the verge of dying. Our only hope is to follow messages from unknown beings to new worlds in another galaxy. And it's going to be one hell of a trip, both for the handful of brave astronauts and the people they leave behind on earth.Put simply, Interstellar is 2001 A Space Odyssey without the long stretches where nothing happens. Not to say that the story is the same beyond the general outline of mankind exploring the cosmos and a mysterious force guiding us. Yet there are so many things about Interstellar that draw the viewer's mind back to that classic of sci-fi. From the often majestic, sometimes hallucinatory visuals of alien worlds, interstellar phenomena and spacecraft gently floating through the void, to the ever present themes of distance and isolation, to the black, slab shaped robot with an attitude like HAL 9000, it's clear that Kubrick's 2001 was very much on Christopher Nolan's mind when he made this.But don't let me give you the impression that this move is all high concepts and deep themes. Interstellar is also a fast paced, suspense filled thriller with all the action, twists, and cutting edge special effects one has come to expect from Nolan. The action scenes are nail biting and visually stunning, with photography clearly influenced by last year's Gravity. In the third act the revelations and close calls come so quickly one after another that the tension builds until you're sure the climax is just around the corner, and yet it keeps on going, tenser than before.Beyond the suspense and the excitement it's the emotional dimension that gives this movie its impact. Because the heroes aren't going into the unknown just to save humanity, they're going to save the people they care about; their children, parents, mentors, the ones who can't even know if they're still alive. And as corny as it may seem, Interstellar makes a good case that more than gravity or even time, it's love that's the most powerful force in the galaxy. In the end you'll likely have as many questions as answers, but that's OK, because the whole point is that there is so much we have yet to discover, and yet that will never stop us from trying.",Interstellar
316,srdjan_veljkovic,"Great momentum, but falls apart near the end",6/10,7 January 2016,"Like all Christopher Nolan films, it has a very interesting premise and introduction. Like most of them, it doesn't live up to it until the end. But, this one actually falls apart harder and uglier than most.It's not just that the science(-fiction) falls apart. The story, the acting, the everything falls apart and leaves a very ""what the hell just happened"" feel to it.I think that Mat Damon's part, which is great and he should play more such roles, actually serves as a divider. After that, it's like looking at a different movie and things might have been better if it just ended around that time.It has many good stuff in there, so it's worth your time, but, it does leave a lot to be desired.",Interstellar
317,dallasryan,Dream Within a Dream,8/10,29 June 2016,"The Nolan Brothers, wow, what can you say. Writer's of Conscious, genius what they come up with. Christopher Nolan is so specific and particular to everything to where it makes most of his movies great. There's so much going on in this movie that I would do Interstellar injustice by putting it in a vacuum, so I will simply state that I wasn't sure how I felt about this movie until the last 20 minutes came and brought it altogether where it hit you out of nowhere on how brilliant it was. Amazing how certain films can do that. Lost in Translation and Found are the same way. Not sure how I felt about the films until the very end, and then the ending is what brought it altogether. The ending for Interstellar, Lost in Translation and Found are what made these films beyond great, the ending of these films are what made these films transcend themselves beyond the boundaries of greatness. And somehow Nolan's genius transcends greatness with this film.In a way, Interstellar is almost a spiritual sequel to Inception i.e. 2 days after I had finished watching Interstellar, I had a dream about something in my life that then went to the scene where Mcconaughey's character is crying profusely as he drives forth, leaving his daughter behind. I woke up from my dream and thought about that scene all day, and then thought about how great Interstellar was, and all kinds of different emotions, feelings and sensations were filling my body. As if I had gone through Inception, a dream within a dream. As if an idea and feelings had been put into my head. It felt like Inception. I thought how genius it was for the movie Inception to lead you to Interstellar. I thought perhaps this was how Nolan had been lead to the idea, the concept of it all.",Interstellar
318,badajoz-1,Mr Nolan Snr -you should not have taken your son to see '2001',1/10,12 November 2014,"This really is an extremely poor film by any standards. Obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels! 'Memento, was absolutely brilliant, but Christopher Nolan's films from then on have got worse and worse -a distinct case of the Emperor,s New Clothes! 'Inception' was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation, but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever.For a start it is obvious that Nolan went to see '2001 - A Space Odyssey' when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further. Um, well messrs Clarke and Kubrick made a better job of it! That,s the end of the film written off - don,t pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the 'Star Wars' imagery. The main plot is mankind is doomed, and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us. A few films have done this better. There is no money for space exploration apparently, but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space! Please! When the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble 'Total Recall!' And it does not get any better as we rerun 'Gravity' and '2001' before the Starchild repeat. Plot goes even more haywire then. There is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely. The space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by 'Gravity' so the spectacle is empty and ungripping. The actors try but who cares about such an over-hyped, unbelievable piece of twaddle and s.....!A note to mr Nolan jnr - go and watch 'Shane' if you want to make a movie about love and family. Otherwise, give us all a rest from your ill-conceived so-called masterpieces!",Interstellar

And if that made no sense, please watch the movie.It is astounding, fascinating, and mental chess are good words to use for a movie description here.",Interstellar
322,jeremy3,A good movie with some flaws.,7/10,16 July 2018,"The movie was very exciting and had a good cast. People on Earth could only grow corn now due to a blight. There were a lot less people and most lived in rural areas growing corn. Even the New York Yankees had relocated to the country. Matthew McConaughey plays a farmer who once was a top pilot. He and his daughter somehow figure out where a secret NASA base is located. When they investigate they are captured and one of the people there is an old professor of his played by Michael Caine. Caine believes that the World will end in two generations due to a projected corn blight. McConaughey is recruited to take a crew through a wormhole to a neighboring galaxy where there are three planets that may support life. An early mission, led by an astronaut played by Matt Damon, disappeared on one of the planets. When the crew arrives on the planet where the astronaut is located, it turns out that the astronaut had been playing a con game. He pretended that there was urgency to come to the planet to save humankind, but in reality he cowardly just wanted to be rescued from the isolation of being the only person on the planet. There is also the duplicity of NASA in believing that they could let all of humanity die while letting a few colonizers continue life on a new planet. 
 The movie was very good with a great story, but had a few flaws. Firstly, when the crew arrives on the first planet there is nothing but still water a few feet deep. However, suddenly miles away a giant tidal wave about one thousand feet high appears. It only takes a few moments to get to within a few hundred yards of the space ship. The tsunami in Indonesia a few years ago was only about twenty feet high, but traveling at 535 miles per hour. It would seem logical that a thousand foot high tsunami would be traveling faster and with even more deadly force. Yet, suddenly the tsunami slows down and gives the astronauts tons of time to get back into the space ship. Still, one astronaut is killed when the female astronaut, played by Anne Hatthaway, insists on retrieving important data left by the previous exhibition to the planet. One of the four astronauts is killed. And, the force of the tsunami that big would probably destroy and crush even the strongest built space craft. 
 Another major flaw was that the movie assumed that all of the audience understood what was going on. Not everyone understands all the science involved and the movie needed to do a better job explaining how the science was plausible. The only possible explanation for the spaceship surviving the massive tsunami is the word ""gravity of 130%"". The significance of 130% was not very well explained. 
 Another problem had to do with the DVD I was watching. Some DVDs are not very good with sound. Oftentimes, characters were practically whispering, particularly Matthew McConaghey's character. There was some important dialogue going on, but I could not hear a lot of it. 
 Lastly, the last part of the movie was very complicated. While I did understand the concept of Love and the connections between events in the movie, particularly with his daughter and how she reacted to his abandoning the family for the mission, it seemed fantastic. The robot and the female astronaut eject from the space station, but the main character does not. Not really explained. Also, at some point, he ejects from his space craft. Not really explained. Also, I was wondering how a space craft could travel through this enormous worm hole at fantastic speeds and not hit one of the countless objects in the worm hole. It would take an exact projection of where all possible objects could be located to avoid the space ship from being destroyed. 
 Fantastically, the main character is rescued by the NASA station. The NASA Station was able to be refitted and went into space, becoming a two-dimensional circular micro World where some of humanity had survived (there was an eighty year time lapse due to the astronauts going deep into space and time becoming relatively faster). 
 Overall, a very good movie. Some things needed to be explained better. The movie got a bit confusing towards the end.",Interstellar
323,chubarova,Masterpiece.,10/10,28 April 2020,"If you love space theme, you dream about journey through universe, this film is for you. Firstly, the plot is mind-blowing, actually I don't expect anything lese because the director of film if genius Christopher Nolan. One of the favourite aspect in his film is time issue. This film solve the time problem from another side if it is compared with Inception. The drama and tradegy are also perfectly shown. Secondly, the cast is brilliant, I don't want to highlight someone because all actors and actresses shown the great performance despite of main character or supporting role. Thirdly, visual effects are wonderful, I don't recommend watch this film on little screen. I had feeling that I was on that spaceship when I watched the film.
So, it's one of genius work from great master of cinema.

325,Jerghal,Cinema with a capital C,9/10,23 November 2014,"I only saw the teaser for this film (for the rest I didn't watch or read anything about the film, I like to know as little as possible about a Nolan film before I see it) and it had me a bit worried: we see McConaughey as a farmer and something about a space program. For a second I was thinking it would have some similarities with the horrible 'Astronaut Farmer' film, but who are we kidding. This is Chris Nolan we are talking about and he does not disappoint. Nolan makes Cinema with a capital C. Interstellar is an epic movie about the survival of mankind, but it's also philosophical, scientific and convincingly dramatic thanks to the great performances of all actors. There are jaw-dropping shots in this film that only work on a big screen (the IMAX version is probably even more awesome) and the subwoofer rumbling of the spacecrafts made the cinema seats tremble. The drama works very well with the superb score of Hans Zimmer who got a lot of inspiration from the Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack and some from Event Horizon. The plot is incredibly well written by Nolan and his brother but it's not perfect as there are some events that happen for dramatic effect or creative license and don't always seem realistic. This film is one that scifi fans will love and should also please general audiences. The only complaint maybe is that at 170mins this isn't a short film (and there was no pause in Kinepolis) as I felt it in my legs after having to sit still so long. I very highly recommend this film. See it in the cinemas or you will surely regret it later",Interstellar

327,ghost_dog86,Ghost Protocol,6/10,13 November 2014,"There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within ""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, ""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.",Interstellar
328,ArmandoManuelPereira,"Unnecasarily Long, Yet At Times Brilliant And Visually Beautiful",7/10,8 December 2020,"I question the films length, and whether it might be one of the factors working against its overall enjoyment. To be sure their are brilliant moments and visually beautifully scenes, particularly those involving the dust storms, the massive tidal wave, and Manns icy planet. But the film also has silly moments that are less then Narratively satisfying, or unecassary plot devices, such as Manns betrayal and attempted murder of Cooper. I think the movie would have worked better condensed and shortened. On the other hand their are intellectual pleasures and emotional scenes that also make it not all together a bad experience.

329,talisencrw,One of the best science fiction films ever made! =),10/10,16 January 2016,"Though I haven't seen all of Nolan's films, I have greatly enjoyed what I have seen so far (Insomnia, the Batman trilogy, and Inception), and with sci-fi being one of my favourite genres, seeing 'Interstellar' eventually was a no-brainer for me. Despite its 169 minutes, it didn't seem long at all (if a film is well made, then the longer, the better) and it's resoundingly clear that Christopher is excellent both in getting fine performances from his actors and, along with his brother Jonathan, in writing scripts. What makes the film special for a sci-fi work is that he doesn't have to show any monster--nothing is truly more scary than humanity itself. This is a work that can combine an excellent explanation of the theory of relativity yet still show that the only things that truly matter are the relationships we develop in our everyday lives. My favourite film of all-time is still one of the most ambitious, '2001: A Space Odyssey', but it's very comforting to me that six generations after the birth of cinema, and the Faberge eggs of genius that have come along the way, from Georges Méliès' 'A Trip to the Moon' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', that outstanding works of science fiction, such as 'Gravity', 'Ex Machina' and this fine film by Nolan, are still being made. There's hope for us yet!...

330,ivanmessimilos,2014 Interstellar Odyssey,10/10,9 November 2014,"I will not lie. If you had one year ago asked me ,personally, what is the most anticipated movie of 2014, the answer would be this film. About this film we did not know much, which says a lot about trailers that are now recorded as they have revealed almost the entire movie. In short, our planet Earth is dying and we can save it only through special mission that travels far into space. What is interesting is that the film is based on the theory of relativity and black holes and on film worked physicist Kip Thorne as a producer which gives a weight. The film lasts 169 minutes, which is practically three hours, but not a single minute was not boring. With this film Nolan did what Kubrick done with 2001 Odyssey 1968, he was ahead of his time. I know some will say that the problem is a big difference in technology and budget, but I find it incomparably. Clearly, there are numerous references to Odyssey during the movie and I was pleased when I saw the link, however, Nolan brings something new, something of his own and therefore I consider him a genius. Visually, the film is perfect. When watching it, then you do not see the CGI effects, you actually viewing space! Of course, in this film there is a turnover that perhaps many will not like but I am absolutely thrilled with a twist and the end of the film. It's very ambitious, I admit, it causes you to think and use our gray cells, but is it not that the goal of the film (or should be)? Why do we like movies? Why do we go to the cinemas? I am absolutely delighted with all aspects of the film, starting with the lead actor, story, visual effects, music, plot and ending. I'm not even a little bit disappointed despite great anticipation and so pure a ten from me.",Interstellar
331,Bruce722,Great potential but Nolan got in his own way... as usual.,7/10,18 April 2015,"Interstellar is your typical Christopher Nolan film. It has an incredible score that plays throughout essentially the entire movie, beautiful visuals, an interesting and captivating plot, great acting, great character and setting development, a heavy reliance on suspended disbelief, and enormously huge plot holes. Some people don't mind them but I have trouble with plot holes so big that they actively go against what has already been established in the story arc. Forewarning, the following sentences will contain SPOILERS that are as big as the plot holes they discuss. Now I won't get into the details on every single little plot hole and inconsistency because this review would become way too long. I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the ""really good but not great"" category where so many other films reside.",Interstellar
332,fung0,Stupidity on a Grand Scale,3/10,8 April 2015,"If this movie were set in, say, the Wonderful Land of Oz, it might stand up as a lightweight fantasy. Very lightweight. But dressed in the trappings of science fiction, it's simply appalling.True, it does look purdy, with all that computer graphic stuff slathered all over the screen. And it does tell a story, of sorts: the dad who wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter. It actually could have worked. But the story meanders for hours and hours, and any semblance of logic is completely abandoned after the trip through the wormhole, making it very hard to care what happens.Just one example: the takeoff from Earth requires a multi-stage rocket on the scale of the Saturn V. The takeoff from a planet ""near the black hole,"" (!) with ""gravity greater than Earth's"" is handled effortlessly by a tiny shuttlecraft. The movie is filled with similar lapses in basic logic. The final events near (and inside!) the black hole are so completely lacking in scientific plausibility that they'd seem embarrassing in a ten-cent comic book. In a multi-hundred-million-dollar epic, the complete disregard of all known science borders on criminal.On the positive side, Interstellar is a better film than Gravity. The science is equally implausible, but the story doesn't depend on the science quite so obviously. Nonetheless, the popularity of feeble junk like this makes a sad comment on the state of knowledge and tastes in our 21st-century society.",Interstellar
333,harrylosborne,A true cinematic masterpiece - flawless from start to finish,10/10,2 May 2019,"Interstellar doesn't put a foot wrong, a brilliant 169 minutes covering space, survival and raw human emotion. Hans Zimmer's near-perfect soundtrack is the ideal accompaniment to these epic scenes, adding drama and gravity to every meticulous shot. Equally, the storyline is beyond gripping, a brutally believable tale of a desperate, dying race driven to do anything for survival, balanced against what a father would do for his children.Christopher Nolan's vision of a dying Earth is a stark blend of oranges and greens - crop fields stretching for miles, only to be overwhelmed by the towering dust storms. Leaving Earth, space (and indeed the planets visited) are all equally magical in their own unique ways: Miller's aquatic landscape is eerily bleak, whilst Mann's ice planet is as mind-bending as it is picturesque. Space travel is also done true justice, using wide-angle shots to both convey the vastness of space and the insignificance of man.Matthew McConaughey was practically built for this role, a farmer-turned-engineer trying to juggle saving earth and saving his family; his interactions with Brand (Anne Hathaway) and his daughter Murphy (Jessica Chastain) define the film, testing the strengths of human relationships and their value, even over the distances of space. Credit must also be given to TARS (Bill Irwin), a superbly written, pseudo-sentient robot that becomes as integral a member of the crew as any other.Interstellar is arguably the best sci-fi/space film ever created, superb in every way. The reported scientific accuracy Nolan paid attention to when writing the film is the icing on the cake, allowing the plot to be full lived - unlike anything that has come before.",Interstellar

335,ajkbiotech,I Saw This at an IMAX Theater,10/10,20 March 2021,"I originally saw this at an IMAX theater in Boston and I must confess, this film was visually stunning and powerful in every way imaginable.It takes Einstein's notions of time, space and relativity, which I actually studied at Harvard University with a pretty smart Professor, and intelligently applies them to actual space travel, time dilation, and the issue of multiple universes/timelines, which have been addressed in scholarly works.A powerful film with a cogent message about ecology & the climate change problem on Earth.Have rewatched it several times; it only gets better. It also is a story of the bond between two intelligent, yet introverted scientific minded individuals, the father & daughter at the heart of the film.

336,Scott_Mercer,Overrated,4/10,18 November 2014,"I can't knock the look of the film and the excellence of the special effects, but the script was just too long and flabby. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey as directed by M. Night Shymalan. This is a problem you sometimes get where the director and the writer are the same person. Nolan is just too in love with his own script and can't possibly bring himself to make the tough editing choices that need to be made. I could have cut almost a full hour from this film and made it much better. And somebody should have. And yet, among the long stretches of the film that drag and are boring, there are a few parts that feel ignored and rushed.The ""ghost"" subplot was just too predictable and hacky, something that Shymalan would have put into one of his movies, while patting himself on the back for his extreme cleverness. McConnaughey doesn't take too many chances here. While he brought welcome humanity to a cold movie, this is familiar territory for him. Anne Hathway was fine. Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were excellent. I should also bring up the difficulties with the sound mix, causing important dialog to be difficult to understand. Hans Zimmer's omnipresent, throbbing, overdone score was like a party guest that would not leave long after he had become unwelcome.Overall, not terrible but really overrated.",Interstellar

338,ssvikas,"Scores on effects, fails on narrative!",5/10,22 July 2015,"Christopher Nolan is known to experiment, such as the the non-linear narrative of 'Memento' and well written characters in 'The Dark Knight'. A director of his caliber also made the disappointing pseudo- intellectual 'Inception'. Sadly, 'Interstellar' too comes across as a let-down of sorts, despite interesting science.'Interstellar' has all the ingredients of a typical space sci-fi film: spacecraft, wormholes, stasis, strange planets, time travel, a black hole, robots running on artificial intelligence, father-daughter drama, etc., in the background of a dying Earth. While these concepts aren't new to Hollywood, the big budget allowed for the visual spectacle. Still, it is marred by choppy narrative, clichéd dialog and poorly developed characters that we hardly care about.Set in unspecified future, Earth's capacity to sustain life has diminished; crops are dying and there are dust storms. Agriculture takes precedence over everything. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test pilot turned farmer. A widowed Cooper lives with his father in law and children Tom and Murph. An inquisitive young Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is obsessed with the idea of a ghost in her bedroom and is always trying to decode signs.As it turns out, the signs are coordinates to a hidden space station of NASA, headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), in search of life sustaining planets so as to evacuate Earth. Predictably, our hero, Cooper is the only man who can pilot the mission to outer space, beyond our galaxy accessed through a wormhole. Damn, a trespasser at a hidden space station is suddenly asked to commandeer a spaceflight without any serious briefing or training!Joining Cooper on the mission are Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists that are expendable. Their mission is finding three of the ten manned probes that went through the portal earlier and have reported seemingly positive findings. Again, don't ask why manned missions when they had advanced AI robots like TARS and CASE? That brings us to the existential question: why a manned follow-up mission, huh?The overarching premise behind the mission is that certain benevolent 'beings' have opened up a wormhole and left clues through gravity- based anomalies. The aging professor has been working on a mathematical model to evacuate Earth. The model fails since it needs data from a gravitational singularity, where space and time can be bent. If Plan- A, to evacuate fails, Plan-B to populate extraterrestrial planets with genetic samples humans.Unbeknownst to the fatality of Plan-A, the crew continues to explore planets. One Planet has time distorted to a level where an hour on it equals seven years on earth. The planet doesn't make the cut due to its shallow waters and gigantic waves. The second is an icy planet with ice-clouds (filmed in Iceland) and a crazed explorer (Matt Damon) who tries to kill Cooper so that he can execute plan B at the third planet, Miller; Result: needless drama.As with every movie involving vehicles, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, fuel shortage and damage to the craft and the need for Singularity data are key plot elements towards the climax. Apropos, they need to slingshot past the black hole to the third planet which Amelia bets on, as her loved one went there during the original Lazarus project. Oh, a movie is so incomplete without a love angle! Glad there wasn't any romance between Cooper and Ameila.And then, our hero, Cooper dives into the event horizon of the beautifully depicted super-massive black hole and reaches singularity. But what is this singularity? Just like the limbo being linked to Cobb's dreams in 'Inception', the singularity in 'Interstellar' is actually a four dimensional tesseract presenting a single location to Cooper at various points in time. And the location? You guessed it: Murph's bedroom. How convenient!So, who's the ghost in Murph's life? Cooper! And the 'beings'? Cooper again! He opened up the wormhole near Saturn that took him through the same spot half a century later. Doesn't this create an inconsistent causal loop just like 'Grandfather Paradox' or a chicken going back in time and laying an egg that it is born out of? But then, an average moviegoer doesn't care as long as there are spectacular sights and happy endings!'Interstellar' is lengthy and tiresome, narrative is patchy and has excessive inter-cuts during crucial scenes. Spoiling experience further is the jarring and ominously heavy background score by Hans Zimmer that muffles out dialog. Acting is just passable: McConaughey is hardly a fit, Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is decent as the scientist and Michel Caine seems to be having his fourth outing with the director.Nolan's fiction works for audiences who believe they enjoy intelligent films, but actually watch them without thought or logic. As contradictory as it sounds, truth is stranger than fiction. Nolan's 'Inception' was full of plot holes, irrespective of whether it was deliberate or inept storytelling. Usually, a good narrative should have a logical end, except that it is Nolan and he likes keeping things ambiguous. I haven't come across anyone who understood 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' fully, despite claiming that they loved it.About the science in 'Interstellar', Nolan found played it safe by bringing a scientist on board, Kip Thore, as a consultant and executive producer. This would've surely had an impact on the depiction of a spinning black hole and other stuff like the four- dimensional tesseract within the event horizon, boxy but versatile AI robots, etc. Nonetheless, I'm still amazed at how an astronaut can dive into a black hole and come out totally unhurt!!If anything, Christopher Nolan must be admired for dreaming big. Sadly, this movie is a waste of a great concept turned into an average movie that sells only the basis of special effects bankrolled by a big budget. While die-hard Nolan fans would rave over this, discerning movie connoisseurs won't appreciate the poor storytelling.",Interstellar
339,g-hbe,A potentially great film but.....,4/10,27 May 2018,"...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser.
Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?

340,brianberta,An entertaining movie but not as good as some make it out to be,4/10,17 July 2015,"Many people nowadays say that Nolan is one of the greatest directors ever and all of his movies are masterpieces. However, there is a smaller group of people who say that while Nolan is a talented director, he's not the film making genius that fans make him out to be. Interstellar is a prime example of this.After Earth faces extinction due to a dust bowl, 4 astronauts and an intelligent robot are sent into space in hopes of finding a planet suitable for life.Firstly, I'm going to talk about the positives. Many people say that the third act makes no sense but actually the science in it holds a lot of credibility. I'm not going to go into detail about it because then this review would be as long as the movie is. But I can assure you that it's not incorrect. Realism isn't necessary is sci-fi movies but when movies do feature them, it makes them more entertaining so I appreciate what Nolan has done.I really like the cgi. It is well-done and it immerses the viewer into certain scenes. Matthew McConaughey gave a great performance. It's not the greatest one ever like some people say but it's still pretty great. All of the other actors and actresses give good performances too but McConaughey did the best. Also, the ending was great too.Now I'm going to get to the negative points. Firstly, the movie has clear issues with the pacing. This is most noticeable in the beginning as many grew bored as we impatiently waited for the shuttle to leave Earth. This sequence felt slower compared to the rest of the film.Also, the movie has poor character development. That's not to say that there aren't characters you can connect with. In fact, Cooper's relationship with Murph is well- done but the same can't be said about his other offspring, Tom. He is seen as a secondary character and gets little attention from Cooper which seems unrealistic.People say that Zimmer's score is fantastic. I find it catchy but it's not as good as it's made out to be. Most of the songs consist of just one tune being repeated over and over again. Much of Zimmer's work lacks variety and Interstellar is a prime example of this. Also, it plays unnecessarily loud. It drowns out all of the other background noise. It took me out of the experience. In an interview, Nolan made the argument that it shakes the seats which is supposed to immerse you but the score still played louder than it need to be. It would've still shook the seats if it played quieter.Also, there's the endless exposition. Nolan had issues with this before but Interstellar is perhaps his worst offender yet. It bogs the audience down under many hypothetical theories so often that the movie runs the risk of feeling more like an educational video on scientific concepts than it does a work of entertainment. I wish that he would leave his films more ambiguous. That way, there would be more of a reason for me to revisit them.Also, the planet with the waves wasn't that important to the plot. It felt more like a side plot. It didn't have as much to do with the plot as the second one did. I wish that more time was spent on it.Another big problem I had with the film was that it used the annoying 'fake death' cliché so often. This is when it seems like a character is about to die, only for them to come back to life. This was used in the tesseract scene. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought ""It's so sad that Cooper's probably gong to die since his chances of survival are pretty much infinite."" However, after I saw that he still survived, and after I watched the movie a second time, the sad and suspenseful feelings that I originally had vanished. The tesseract scene does nothing for me anymore. In fact, it even annoys me.In conclusion, Interstellar is a bad movie. It may have some positive points and its ambition and thought shines through. However, don't be fooled by the 10/10 ratings. This is not one of the greatest movies ever made. This is mediocre. It doesn't come close when compared to 2001.",Interstellar
341,Spideyfan-963-246215,Interstellar Review,5/10,7 September 2016,"Interstellar(2014) Starring:Matthew McConaughey,Anne Hathaway,Jessica Chastain,Michael Caine,Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn,Matt Damon,John Lithgow,Timothee Chalamet,Mackenzie Foy,Wes Bentley,Bill Irwin and Topher Grace Directed By:Christopher Nolan Review MANKIND WAS BORN ON EARTH. IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO DIE HERE. Let's travel to a parallel world in the new film Star Trek I mean Interstellar. But seriously what's the damn difference,this movie is about space exploration for an inhabitable world and Star Trek is just still space exploration. The film is about a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage. I honestly could not tell you if this film achieved it's goal or not because I'm not sure if it's trying to be fun or just something else. It tries to be a serious exciting adventure into space so I am going to go with it trying to be fun,but in which case it isn't. I was so bored during this movie. The film is way too long they could have finished it sooner but decide not too and it just makes that much harder to sit through. The story is not that interesting,with it's theme being about you know take care of the earth which we've seen to death in some better movies. The film is getting massive talks for reasons I don't know but I'm going to go with the venturing through space and it's awesome CGI which a film does not make. The performances from the film are solid even from actors who I don't find too be great but just OK(Topher Grace). The standouts however are Michael Caine,Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.They were my favorite part of the movie as for everything else,I just found to be boring. The direction from Christopher Nolan this time around is not all that great,he gets good performances out of his actors OK but he always does. The problem was the shots and worst of all I saw lens flares,is he turning into J.J Abrhams. The only worthwhile point from the movie is what I had just mentioned earlier,it's about taking care of our planet,but like I've said we have better films then this for that. The movie is also way too long,i did find a problem with it's pacing everything feels slow. I believe it's because Nolan wants us to take in everything were seeing on screen. The elements of a good film are not here much,it has great Cgi and some good acting but that's about it. I didn't care for the characters and I wasn't invested in anything that was going on, I'm giving Interstellar a two out of five.",Interstellar
342,Lewis_Heather787,Almost perfection and completely underrated!,9/10,2 June 2018,"Going back to a film roughly four years after its release is actually a really interesting way of viewing how your opinion on a film can change or stay the same. Back 2014 I remember that this was one of the the most anticipated films of the year, Christopher Nolan directing a science fiction film. My main take away from the film was the grand perspective and direction that the film had, the sense of really pushing the boundaries in terms of what can be portrayed on film. Overall I absolutely fell in love with the film four years ago and now 2018 I pretty much have the same feelings towards the film. Almost perfection and completely underrated however it does have a few problems. Chris Nolan's directing is impeccable throughout the film with so many styles of camera format and frame put into one film it is hard to keep up, you will either hate this or love it and I tend to love it. Even in 2018 I still think its some of his best directing in all of his films. Insanely good!You know that the creators of a film are taking it seriously when they are getting creative help from an actual physicist in Kip Thorne. The story of the film is one of the most complex stories in film, I no Im probably wrong in that statement, so many layers and separate stories being weaved in and out perfectly. Combining all these story threads and building the film around a foundation of real science, to a certain degree, is a true achievement. The film is giving a science lesson with out you realising it. I encourage anyone who loves this film to watch the making of this film and especially the stuff about Kip Thorne's involvement in the project, extremely fascinating. The cast of the film could not be anymore brilliant everyone from McConaughey to Caine they are all superb in there various roles. Standouts for me are probably McConaughey, Chastain and Hathaway. All of them bring there a game and bring theses characters to life, beautiful crafted by all of them.However there are two cast members that 100% deserve a mention, not only do the actors but Chris Nolan and production team to. Not since, ""HAL"" in ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" or C3P0 and R2-D2 in ""Star Wars"", have two robotic characters been some memorable and fantastically used. Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart have done fantastic voice work and I think Irwin actually operated both of them manually for majority of the time, apart from the CG scenes. They bring two seemingly boring and not pretty looking blocks to life in that way is incredible, a truly fantastic achievement. The dialogue written for them, especially TARS, is fantastic and some of the highlights of the film.The last positives are the cinematography,production design and score. The cinematography and production design are faultless throughout and are mesmerising. The screen in beautiful and jaw dropping to look at with some really creatively design spacecraft. However one of the biggest highlights of the film is the score and for me personally the best score every created. I said it back in 2014 and I'll say it now, for me personally it is the best score ever, pure genius and magic from Hans Zimmer. That docking scene........the score is amazing and at the end with ""Brand"" tear jerking.Lastly there are a couple of negatives, firstly the film is way to long, about 20 minutes to long, I've always wondered if the film should have ended when ""Copper"" enters the black hole, could have been a cliffhanger. Im not to sure on this meet older ""Murph"" stuff at the end, its just not needed I don't think, I know the film is trying to give an emotional punch but it really doesn't work for me. More importantly though what happened to ""Tom"", like what happened to him we have no idea and actually the whole film/story completely shafts his character, was there much point having the character in the film?Overall 95% out of 100% or 9.5 out of 10 simply brilliant and almost perfect just a few little problems here and there. Completely underrated not only for Christopher Nolan but for Sci-fi films. Not for everyone, you either love it or hate it and I love it!",Interstellar
343,MJB784,"Good, but not great",7/10,21 May 2018,"Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped.

344,Dragonsouls,One of the top 5 science fiction films of all time.,9/10,17 November 2014,"Science Fiction films are rare these days, extremely rare. I know that's hard to believe, given the fact that we are in a super-hero golden age, but when you think about it, most sci-fi these days are fantasy films. The new Star Trek films included. Interstellar is a rare science fiction film, because the plot is built around the science fiction itself. Studiers of Quantum Physics will absolutely devour this film! The visuals bring me back to Kubrick's 2001. Instead of CGI, Christopher Nolan decided to use models for the space craft just like Kubrick did in 2001 when he paved the way for sci-fi films, including George Lucas' Star Wars. The results are stunning, and Interstellar is space opera at its finest. When you couple haunting visuals with outstanding sound mixing and Hans Zimmer's masterful score, you just might forget to blink!I will say however, that I was rather disappointed with the art direction in this film. The ships were okay looking, both inside and out, and the settings on the alien planets didn't wow me. But I'm not sure they were supposed to. They were supposed to be Earth-like planets after all.I can't say enough about the acting, it was absolutely brilliant all around, and by every part of the cast. Did I even mention Nolan's editing? I would rather call him a film editor 1st and a director 2nd. He's the best at pacing films, with his patented style of quick cutting scenes. But this is expected of Nolan. What I did not expect was the sentimental parts of the story. Nolan's biggest weakness is usually his inability to implement human elements in his stories, but that is not the case with Interstellar. This was a story of a father's logical thinking, clashing with his emotional thinking. It was very dramatic.As unique as this film was, there were some influences from 2001, mostly in the visual department. I also thought that it borrowed some plot devices from Apollo 13. Still, in the end, Interstellar is one of the most innovative science fiction films in decades. A dying planet. Humanity at a precipice. And a story based around the almost religious theory of direct panspermia. I also was surprised to see a supernatural element in the story. As a science fiction writer myself, I know how difficult it can be to bridge the gap between scientific theory and the mystical. And Christopher Nolan managed to do exactly that. He took the science fiction genre and made it his own! The film might not be the ground breaking film that Kubrick's 2001 was, but it still sets a standard!",Interstellar
345,heisenberg12,Not So Stellar,7/10,26 October 2015,"It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a ""pretty good"" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent.",Interstellar
346,Jared_Andrews,A visual and auditory marvel,10/10,13 April 2016,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",Interstellar
347,L_Copa,"Very original script, Great Directing, Stunning acting!",8/10,3 December 2019,"Wow what a performance from Matthew McConaughey !! Maybe Oscar worthy! A well written original script with this great directing makes viewer's mind to blow! The only bad thing is the music... For me terrible choices for music.... It could have been epic... A plot that wanders in people's minds for decades! Ann and Julia Roberts were a great addition in the cast. I wanted Caine's and Matt Damon's roles a little bit different but ok, watchable!

348,solojere,what the fu Just happened?!!?!,1/10,7 August 2015,SO this movie wasn't that bad but it isn't as good as people make it out to be for sure. For one the movie is very slow at the start. And Matthew McConaughey's character is no good guy he kinda only cares about himself for about 95% of the movie. There are some good moments but the end just gets weird!! It goes 100% unrealistic with and then makes tries to McConaughey people try to defend the film by saying it is all realistic but for one I find it hard to believe that the planet is dying but we still have oil and gas for our cars. And even if it there is some real theory behind parts of the movie the last 30 mins ruin any credibility that had been setup. so all in all it's OK but nothing great and don't listen to the sheep!!,Interstellar

351,Saiph90,Good not great,7/10,19 April 2015,"I love Sci-Fi movies but I like them believable if that is not a total oxymoron, so this was right up my street, what did I like, the start of the film was brilliant of an Earth ravished by failing crops and people battling against this plight and still carrying on a day to day existence, I think there was a movie in this alone. I enjoyed the cinematography the sound track and interesting story which at times gave a serious nod to Space Oddity. I also feel there is a movie to be made about when we contact an alien race without them wanting to conquer Earth about how we cope if things we believe in are shown to be false. Back to the movie what did I dislike, Matthew McConaughey mumbling his way through the movie maybe it's my English ears but I usually have the sound at 15-20 for a movie to try to decipher what he was saying we had the sound racked up to 80 so I guess the sound quality did not transfer to the small screen. The story I think was a bit to convoluted but overall a decent film if not a great film.",Interstellar
352,robsta23,First Official Review on a Nolan Movie,6/10,25 March 2015,"I love Christopher Nolan. He has a distinct style, he conveys consistent/similar themes in his films, and he usually directs actors well and makes good cast choices. This film, however, falls somewhat flat for me.I'll get the spoiler out of the way because it is one of the main problems for me. This being the second time viewing the film, I looked for information on the black hole, harnessing gravity, and saw how it was explained well in the movie. What is not explained very well is why the black hole specifically sent Cooper to Murph's bookcase. He claims that ""we sent ourselves here,"" but with that logic then futuristic humans needed to place the black hole/tesseract there and select for him to view the bookcase specifically. He didn't place that black hole, so how could he have sent himself there if there don't exist future humans to place it for him. Paradoxes are great in certain sci-fi films such as 12 Monkeys and Looper, but this paradox falls short of greatness.Back on Earth while Cooper is on his mission, things are pretty dead and boring. One of the most intriguing scenes is Dr. Brand's death bed reveal that he has been lying to/betraying the people at NASA, but we can't even hear all of what he is saying due to how he was directed to say it. We get he is dying, but with a barely audible voice in the mix with some eerie noise/music to set the mood. And to think that Roeper actually thought this film would win both sound-related Oscars.There are poor casting choices in this film as well. A lot of characters portray sadness in this movie, but the only actors to pull this off effectively are McConaughey and Matt Damon - plus the younger version of Murph; that scene was very emotional. Jessica Chastain, who one critic praised before the release of the film, did a sub-par job as older Murph, which is disappointing when we look at Zero Dark Thirty and her Oscar caliber performance. I didn't believe her when she cried - and even if I did she still seemed like a little girl, and not grown up as she should be. On top of this, the character comes to the conclusion that Cooper is her ghost due to revisiting her morse code notes and looking at the watch she was given by her father, which means she relatively bases this conclusion on no evidence. And really, Nolan? Topher Grace? Yeah, because it was so dramatic when you see him grab that object with the means to fight Tom off. The Earth segment of the film was just trying way too hard to be dramatic when all the real drama was happening on Cooper's voyage.I have to admit, the film intrigued me emotionally with Cooper's relationship with Murph and his struggle to prioritize the human race over family, but this film also clearly shows why Nolan is considered a very overrated director.",Interstellar
353,santiagocosme,Pretty good. But not that good.,7/10,22 November 2014,"I could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie, especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. Honestly, I don't think it's the case. It will be one of the top movies of the year but that's about it. Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of ""nothing is more powerful than love"". Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity. All in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch.

354,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Stellar and flawed!!,8/10,9 November 2014,"Interstellar. It is hard not to expect anything but the best when you are watching a Christopher Nolan movie. After all, he has earned this high level of expectation from his every movie. Interstellar, is his most ambitious work. When other film-makers try to make you believe that there might be other planets for us to live, Nolan goes two steps further and show you such three planets. This movie is a grand cocktail of science fiction, human emotions and their never ending survival instincts. He succeeds big time except for the middle portion involving character of Matt Damon. If you can forgive Nolan for this, then Interstellar is one of the rare cinematic experience that will be cherished forever. Nolan deliberately avoids CGI and that's why all the special effects feel so real. Performance wise Matthew McConaughey is more than brilliant and keeps you glued to the screen. Second best are the robots which are simple and more humane than humans in the movie.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Interstellar. To Nolan, you want to give a perfect 10 for his ambition and fearlessness. Like Spielberg, he is bound to go into history as most influential film maker for current and coming generations.",Interstellar
355,TheOny13,Unprecedented!,10/10,23 September 2020,"You know, sometimes when you watch a movie for the first time and then 5 or 10 years later you rewatch it, it's not all that good or amazing how you thought it was the first time you watched it. And honestly that is something normal to every human being. We're all in a process in our lives and we change every minute of our lives. But every now and then comes a movie that strikes you so hard the first time around and then the more you watch it, the more you realize just how good it is. That's the case for me with Interstellar. A movie that I adored ever since I watched it the first and second time in theater. A movie that inspired me, a movie that I quote sometimes and a movie that simply put just leaves you wondering about the vastness of space and what could lie for us out there in the sky. Never did I had that feeling of wonder and amazement at space and at what could be out there like I did watching this movie. So, what makes Interstellar such a compelling and amazing movie for me?Plot Analisys:So, the movie kicks off with Cooper, our main protagonist who has a dream about once flying a NASA aircraft. Then he goes and steals a indian drone while driving his car with his son and daugther. And what I love about this scene is that it sets so expertly the tone of the movie, that humanity or anyone for that matter has to leave something behind in order to go forward. And that's a pretty nice life lesson right there. Then he goes to talk to Tom and Murphy's teachers and the feeling I got there was that this movie accurately predicts the state of the world in the future. The teachers apparently try to controll who their scholars will become and wipe the past by replacing it with stuff that actually are more accurate. Anything sounds familiar about that? This is a world that forgot what it was, forgot sacrifices achieved for humanity. It's a great touch from Nolan suggesting that our society is basically just obsessed about the future and forgets and ignores the past. On the polar oposite are the simple farmers that just try to earn a living from harvesting crop. A world of two polar oposites, perfectly portrayed through a couple of scenes of dialogue. So, when Coop gets back home he discovers an anomaly which he fixes but later happens again and this time is in Murphy's room where dust falls only in certain shapes. It's some kind of a gravitational anomaly. So the message in the anomaly is the cordinates to a place. So when Coop and Murphy, who sneaks into his car, go there they find that it's NASA, or what it remained of it. There they meet Dr. Brand and his daughter Amelia. So Coop gets recruited into piloting a sapce shuttle for a mission of saving humanity by going through a wormhole into another galaxy and finding a suitable planet for humanity. So when they get back home Murphy is angry at Cooper and the scene in which they both say goodbyes it's absolutely heartbreaking. Fantastical acting from both Mackenzie Foy and Matthew McConaughey. So, he leaves with his truck checking his front right seat to see if Murph didn't hide there again. Man, what a legendary scene! So the crew of Cooper, Brand, Doyle and Romilly leave to go to Saturn where the wormhole is. During this time there are some scenes of the crew talking to the people of NASA and to their families back home, and although the pacing is a little bit slow here, the character moments are absolutely necessary here. Eventually they go through the wormhole and get to the other galaxy where there's a black hole and three planets orbiting it. So, they go to the first one (Miller's) which is all covered in water but the water is like maximum of 1 feet high. What could this mean? Forgot to mention that the proximity to the black hole makes time slow down to the point in which 7 years pass on earth for an hour on that planet. Well it turns out the planet has huge waves caused by the gravitational pull to the black hole and the scene spent on this planet is absolutely breathtaking. The flawless CGI, the music and the suspence, it's just a masterclass in making suspencefull scene. Then they come back to the space station Endurance where Romilly waited 23 years for them. Interesting to mention is that if you go and listen to the soundtrack ""They're not Mountains"" every tick of the watch in that track means an hour on earth. I mean, it can't get more genius than that now can it? So they decide to go to Dr. Mann's planet next having found out that Amelia is in love with the astronaut named Edmund who is on the third planet. Here we find out more about Brand's feelings for Edmund and that, as she says, is a proof of a higher plane of existance, a proof we cannot understand nor can we understand that higher existance. I mean, how much more can a movie inspire it's audiences than right here? I like to think this is a reference to divinity and how love for us humans might be a proof of that divinity. So after rationally discusing the situation the crew decides to go to Mann's planet. I'd like to point out that these are genuinely some of the most clever and rational characters I've seen in a main stream movie. They always think before acting, they talk through the next steps and they take mostly rational decisions all the time. Yet, the circumstances are almost always against them. And that's a neat message to the audiences because just like in real life, you could take the best decisions, think everything rationally through and still have certain circumstances stand against you. That's part of our growth as persons and human beings. So they go, and awake Mann from hibernation, but then he tries to maroon them there in order to finish the mission and carry out plan B, because plan A was never an option, said Dr. Brand before dying. Turns out he never did finished the equation that would allow humans to manipulate gravity in order to execute a massive evacuation from Earth. So plan B is all that is left. So Mann tries to get to Endurance but he gets blown into space by an imperfect contact. Then one of the best scenes in the movie and one of the best scenes ever happens as Cooper tries to reconect his shuttle to Endurance. He does but in doing so Endurance is now heading towards Gargantua. See how the movie continually pushes it's characters in stressful and difficult situations even though they almost always make the right decisions. That creates real tension and an uncertainty of what's gonna happen next. Can't praise the movie more for that! So they detach two shuttels and escape Gargantua but Cooper decides to get into one shuttle and go into the black hole. There he ends up in a tesseract where he sees every moment of his daughter's life in her bedroom. There is revealed that the ghost from the begining was Cooper all along. And even though that is not hard to figure out early in the movie, the execution is what stands out for me here. It's the emotional connection between characters that make this scene in the tesseract and the reveal all the more powerfull. So while Cooper was in the tesseract one of his robots also went through the black hole and discovered the solution to the gravitation equation. And then Cooper sends that information to Murph via morse code. After doing that he wakes up near Saturn and is brought onto a space station made with the efforts of Murph, and he gets to see her in her last moments as an old lady. And that scene is heartbreaking and tear jearking. And the movie ends suggesting Cooper goes to Edmund's planet to help Brand start the human colony there. And that's it, that's the wonderful plot for Interstellar.End of Plot AnalysisYou know, the thing I like the most about this movie is, well, everything. From the indescribable wonderful music, to the fantastic CGI combined with practical effects, to the dramatic performances from the both leads of this movie especially McConaughey, to the engaging story and the surprinsing twists, this movie is a phenomenon that rarely happens in Hollywood and a future classic for sure. Starting with the music, this is probably Hans Zimmer's best score. The music stirs a sense of wonder and awe about what could be out there in space. It's engaging when it has to, dramatic when there's the case for that and quiet and sentimental when characters go through tough sepparations or emotional reunions. The special and practical effects combine seamlessly and is good to see that instead of overused like in the more contemporary movies. Then the performances. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances, ranging from calmness to rage to crying and laughter all done without a hint of overacting or exagerating. Anne Hattaway starts off as a solid scientist who is cold and calculated, but as things start to derail she starts to show a more human, emotional side, culminating in her feelings for Edmund sealing the decision to go to Mann's planet instead. This movie also has such a comeplling story that is hard even for someone who doesn't understands the physical concepts this movie poses, to not enjoy the movie for what it is: a story about the realtionship between a dad and his daughter. The only gripe would be that the movie doesn't fully explain the importance of the gravity equation for the evacuation of the human race. Speaking of it, even the humans as a race have a character arc in this movie. They start as a race dying and achieve the first step in human trancendence, in that they harness gravity and manipulate it. Ultimately Interstellar is a phenomenon, a movie that is set to become a future classic and a movie the likes of which is unlikely to get made in the society we live in right now. A movie that belongs to a different age in cinema, an age in which characters had arcs, stories were simple and compelling and the plots were complex and engaging. Truly one of the if not the best movie ever made in my opinion! 10/10",Interstellar

357,kingofdanerds,Been putting this one off for years due to my skepticism,9/10,30 March 2021,"If you were to ask someone to choose a film from 2014, chances are that Interstellar would be a film that they would choose. Interstellar was a big deal upon release in 2014 and for me (as a 12 year old) I remember all the praise that I heard about this film but I never had gotten the chance to watch it. Why? Because I was actually really skeptical over this film. It was until a friend basically said that I should watch it that I finally gave in. Interstellar was directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception and the Dark Knight films) and stars a whole bunch of people including Matthew McConaughey (Dazed and Confused), Anne Hathaway (Les Mis), and Jessica Chastain (It Chapter Two). Again, all of which is to name a few. The film was a critical success and also a financial success, making it the 10th highest grossing film of 2014. Funny enough, as I was writing this review, I found out that there is an unofficial Russian-Ukrainian sequel called Interstelar 2: Operation Terra 2040. Funny.........The film takes place in a dystopian type of Earth where space travel is mostly forgotten to the point that the moon landing was deemed, fake. A farmer named Cooper and his daughter accidentally come across NASA and they recruit Cooper on a mission. Apparently the Earth will be destroyed by famine in a short time and the only possible way is to take a team (including Cooper) through a black hole where there are possible Earth 2's to bring the humans to. It is a risk Cooper is gonna have to take, even if it means being away from his family.Interstellar is a good film. A great film too. I have seen some of the complaints about this film and it seems fitting that I address these complaints and see where my stance is on them. First, is the length of the film. Personally, I do not mind a film being this long as long as what the film is is a great experience. Interstellar is a great experience. If anything, the film should not be shortened due to it's length but rather shortened due to some extraneous scenes. The film can be split into three parts. The second third of the film is were the largely extraneous bits are and I cannot go more in depth unless I want to have a review with spoilers and I do not want that. Honestly, that would be my only complaint about the film hence the nine star rating and not the ten star rating that I nearly gave this film. With that being said, I have seen the complaints centered around the science-ey stuff and whatnot and that is something that might get some people. For me though, I found it pretty straightforward for the most part and if something did not make sense to me at first, it eventually did. I am certaint that I only grasp the mere basics of the film and not all of the things about the relativity and what not, but as long as one has the basics, it should all be fine. For those who are more intellectual might have a blast with this film too. Yes, there is a lot of explaining but for a film like this, I think if there was a lack of explaining, the film would be bad. That is pretty much all of the criticisms that I have heard from others and all of which are very valid points. The positives are far greater than the negatives (obviously). The visuals was something that has been constantly praised and it is not hard to see why. The special effects are great and it is as if they actually filmed this in space. It was that good. The acting is great and so was the directing here. Christopher Nolan is just that good. This film can be easily compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey. For me, 2001 is the better film. What I am trying to say is that there is a sort of similarities between the two. The film has it's emotional moments which are really effective.Interstellar is a great film. I am sure people have minor problems with this film and it is not hard to see why. But if you just decide to turn off your brain and sit back and relax and watch the show, you will be entertained.",Interstellar
358,d_m_s,Mumbling actors and extremely loud music - not a great combination.,3/10,28 September 2015,"I never really felt much interested in Interstellar because I'm pretty bored with Christopher Nolan now. His films are getting increasingly more epic and complex but at the same time, predictable. I just feel I know exactly what I am going to get so don't have any inclination to watch his films.But, stuck for something to watch this weekend, we gave it a go.The last 20 minutes were a bit of an emotional roller coaster (despite what seemed like a few plot holes and inconsistencies, which I need to look into in case I just didn't get it). But it did not make up for the rest of the film, which I found not only boring but irritating.Most of the film I felt was unwatchable because Matthew McConaughey (an over-rated actor whom I don't like anyway) mumbles his way through the entire performance, meaning I had to turn the volume up high to hear what he was saying. However, there are frequent bursts of extremely loud music, far far louder than necessary and since the volume is up high to compensate for mumbling, it constantly suddenly gets too loud to comfortably watch. I had to sit through the whole film with the remote control at the ready, adjusting the volume up and down for the whole duration. When viewing the IMDb boards I can see this is a common problem and it has even been up for discussion in the newspapers. Now, whether Nolan intended this anomaly or not I don't care, it made the film irritating and difficult to watch.Apart from that, I found the whole thing dull. The characters were dull, the storyline was dull and I do not have the desire to watch this film ever again so it has no repeat-viewing value.",Interstellar
359,blakiepeterson,"Christopher Nolan's ""Marnie""",5/10,2 May 2015,"At this point in his career, Christopher Nolan is just as respected as Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his fame. Audiences and critics likewise adore his movies; in response, the movies themselves are artistically ambitious while still providing enough fanfare for the popcorn crowd.One could say that Interstellar is Nolan's Marnie. Marnie followed Hitchcock's seminal The Birds, while Interstellar comes in the wake of the billion-dollar The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan's reign as filmmaking royalty world may not be over, but Interstellar is most certainly his first failure. It's an interesting failure. But no matter how interesting a failure is, a failure is a failure all the same.Like young adult authors and tweenaged girls, Nolan is interested in the apocalypse, or, at least, the beginnings of one. The year the film is set in is unknown, but if it's in our future or in our past, the Earth is clearly in bad shape. A worldwide Dust Bowl is underway, but rather than a few tumultuous years of drought, it's been decades. The only food humanity can live on is corn as most animals have died and all other plants have been ravaged by disease.The second we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), we get the sense that he will be our savior. A former NASA pilot and engineer, he is one of the few people who still believes that the moon landing was real. He is one of the few left that believes that society can do better than its agrarian values. Suddenly, a strange binary pattern appears in the thick dust of his daughter's room. Cooper is startled to find that the pattern codes for a set of mysterious coordinates; coordinates, we later find out, to a secret NASA installation.The head honcho of the organization, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), reveals that there has been a discovery of a wormhole orbiting Saturn. The wormhole, it seems, leads to other dimensions. If you haven't put two and two together yet, this could mean that humanity has the chance to immigrant to another planet and ultimately survive. It doesn't take Cooper long to sign on as the pilot for Endurance, an experimental spacecraft whose mission is to record the data of earlier, similar expeditions. Cooper, however, is plagued by guilt: while he may be the one and only hope for humanity, he is forced to leave his family, no easy feat for a man who gave up his career for his personal life. While I can appreciate Interstellar's deft balance of intimate humanity and accuracy in its science, nothing can hide the fact that, overall, it's a messy, self-indulgent project. At nearly three hours, the audience is forced to sit through a bevy of side-plots, uninteresting dialogue, unbelievably unbelievable plot twists, and endlessly drawn out scenes that are most likely supposed to make the film feel ""epic.""Nolan has proved to be uncompromising in his visions before (The Dark Knight Rises was similar in both length and ambition), and usually, this wouldn't be a bad thing. But after a while, Interstellar begins to feel like the series Lost: at first, it's compelling, but as it moves along, it completely flies off the rails. By the time the film is finished, we're left with a series of questions and a lot of, frankly, stupid answers.There seems to be one too many clues left behind, and when they're solved, it's a little less cerebral and a lot more Nancy Drew. It's as if all of our potential questions were written down only to be addressed in a preposterous manner. The cast, though working their hardest, sometimes give performances that are strained in their emotion (Matt Damon's role is completely unneeded and gives the film its worst scenes).If Interstellar was done as a straight science fiction thriller, like Gravity, it could have been much better. It has all the makings for one: a top-notch cast, a terrific premise, and ingenious art direction. Yet, Nolan tries to pack in any extra details that he can. At its closer, the film resembles a parfait filled five inches past the brim of the cup. It's clear that he wants our minds to be blown, but my mind was simply not blown. I was instead dumbfounded by the idea that Interstellar has been getting good reviews and has been making so much money. It's so overdrawn in everything it does that the once promising feeling of awe is thrown away with a thud and a bang. Nolan is an excellent director, but even the best of 'em can sometimes get carried away: this is Nolan's failure, and while it may not be apparent now, its shelf-life is nowhere near Memento's economic thrills or The Dark Knight franchise's genius.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Interstellar
360,swordsnare,Visually stunning endeavour but...,6/10,20 September 2019,"An admiration of Nolan's beautiful practical effects over computer generated is commendable.Am a fan of most of his work, but this failed to hit home for me. The seemingly arduous runtime accompanied by Han Zimmer's tense score drowning out the dialogue at times; with McConaughey portraying (a somewhat?) plausible scientist, made this quite vexing to view.Again, this a visually stunning film, which makes up for most of this but fails to connect with myself personally. Many of the concepts and theories are of interest, but they are executed with an air of pretension that can't be avoided.

361,isantistao,The Most Important Film Ever Made!,10/10,31 December 2019,"This movie is the most important film ever made, and I mean that.First lets start with the basic premise of this movie which I hope it creates awareness about, which is the idea that the planets resources may very well some day be depleted. And then what?This film is directed by Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest directors of all time next to Francis Ford Coppola and the Coen Brothers. And this is his greatest work of art. And with it comes a handful of the best actors out there.This film explores all of the deepest topics in existence. Time, space, relativity, deep space travel and searching for other planets that could sustain life, how that kind of travel could be possible, how that kind of travel and living on other planets would effect how time passes for the space travelers, how they would age differently than loved ones back home and how that would effect their relationship emotionally, how gravity is related to time and other fascinating theories in physics, and this movie even explores what it might look like inside of a worm hole, black hole, and the fifth dimension!And whats more is that they had a team of the worlds leading physicists consulting with them on the film to make sure that all of the physics portrayed in the film are 100% accurate down to a ""T"". They even released an entire textbook about it afterwords! This movie is more educational than your average documentary, and yet it is not a documentary, it is some of the greatest storytelling you will ever experience.This movie very elegantly connects themes of existentialism/life/death, philosophy/metaphysics/spirituality, physics, relationships/emotions, the future of our world and the universe at large in the most artful cinematic way. It will literally warp your mind and leave you feeling different for the rest of the day. This movie is just so intellectual and so emotional...it is one of the most cerebral experiences you may ever have. It will provoke so many different thoughts and feelings while you watch it, it is just phenomenal. In fact it made me cry more than any movie ever has (I cried 4 times when I first saw it, and I still always cry hard at the end every time).And this movie is so visually stunning, the shots of outer space and different planets are just breath taking. You will really feel like you are in space with them and will be completely absorbed in the movie, and afterwards the world you return to will seem bleak in comparison. It is such an incredible work of art.I rarely ever want to see movies more than once. This movie I saw 4 times in the theater when it came out. I've never done that before, but for all these reasons and more, I just couldn't stop watching it. Then I bought it on DVD and keep watching it again and again since. This movie is literally out of this world. It is a must see for everyone. It is the most important movie of all time. I'd give it at least 11 stars out of 10.",Interstellar
362,scb_coldsteel,Stellar Interstellar!,9/10,2 October 2018,"Finally got around to watching Interstellar. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. From a technical point the film is a masterpiece. Truly stunning CGI and cinematography.The story was had a nice spin on a classic Scifi concept and kept me glued the whole time. Plus it added a few interesting philosophical questions about the nature of humanity and love. As expected From Christopher Nolan directing was outstanding. I'm sorry that I put off watching it for so long. Overall a 9 out of 10.

363,krzysiektom,ludicrous story and too sentimental,4/10,11 November 2014,"I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstellar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that ""love is the only thing (a ""thing""??) which overcomes time and space"". Corny and retarded, and so very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach. I guess the film will be nominated at least for special effects and musical score, but it is far from a masterpiece.",Interstellar
364,Bento_de_Espinosa,Most overrated movie in mankind's history!,1/10,30 January 2015,"This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say: ""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.Good night. And good luck.",Interstellar

This isn't just a movie. It's an emotion.Hans Zimmer music created a huge impact in this movie . I regret not watching this masterpiece in imax. For me the best thing was this didn't come across as your normal Hollywood film with cliches and predictability this was refreshing and hopefully will inspire a whole new generation of people to study astronomy . The director used the concept of Predestination Paradox where the protagonist travels back in time in order to prevent some events. Though many movies used the similar concept but Nolan's way of using the concept is top-notch and it gives you goose flesh.MASTERPIECE (Must Watch).

366,JohnWelles,"Ambitious, Startling: Truly Stellar",9/10,28 January 2015,"""Interstellar"" (2014), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a wildly ambitious science fiction film, an original film that seems an anomaly in contemporary Hollywood, not based on a franchise or well-known book. With a screenplay written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, it belongs to the tradition of inquisitive sci-fi, following in the path struck by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and Roger Zemeckis' ""Contact"" (1997), seeking to explore deep space and what it holds for humanity. It would be churlish to reveal too much about what McConaughey's crew find through the wormhole, but suffice to say that the planets they do explore feel grounded in reasonable conjecture that reflects the real risks of interplanetary travel. The film in particular captures both the frightening beauty of space, courtesy of Hoyte van Hoytema's luminous, beautiful cinematography. One of the film's most powerful scenes is McConaughey watching twenty-three years worth of recorded messages sent by his children, seeing his daughter Murph grow up in a matter of minutes (played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain), a devastating commentary on what is known as ""spacetime"".The scenes on Earth are equally compelling, the first act shows a world not so far in the future suffering from a blight that has ravaged crops across the globe. McConaughey and his family live in the American Midwest which is dominated by dust storms; Nolan cleverly intercuts reminiscences from those who survived the dustbowl during the Great Depression to underline the connection with the past.It's a sign of Nolan's standing that he can pull together such a fine cast: Oscar-winner McConaughey is supported by Anne Hathaway, Academy-award nominee Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine with Bill Irwin providing the voice of the dryly acerbic robot TARS. Nolan deftly juggles both the spectacle (provided by both models for the spaceships and computer-generated imagery) and the characters, creating a fully-rounded film where we're invested in the drama of McConaughey longing to return to his children: it's this trust in emotion rather than the shock and awe of visual effects that gives the film its heart and soul and sets it apart from other Hollywood blockbusters.Nolan's film has an aspiration to greatness that shames all other films in its league; daringly original and ultimately moving, propelled by its organ-driven Hans Zimmer score. Its conclusion though may be too pat, more wish-fulfilment than reality. Yet taking the movie as a whole, it's a forgivable slip in the scheme of a much grander vision.",Interstellar
367,kunalkhandwala,An epic journey by a master film-maker will leave you suspended,10/10,16 November 2014,"Time, in Christopher Nolan's complex world has always been an essential element of his stories and none more so than in the mind-bending 'Inception'. Now, in yet another masterpiece of path-breaking cinema, Nolan brings astrophysics to the masses and deals with space-time concepts that are at the forefront of the final attempt to save the human race from extinction. 'Interstellar' is an intelligent film that takes you through an epic journey of human will, emotion and sacrifice against the backdrop of some of the most stunning visuals ever witnessed on IMAX. A worldwide blight has wiped out all crops except corn and capitalism has taken a back seat to conservation. The Earth is now a ball of dust with frequent haboobs storming through towns. A former test pilot for NASA, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), has been forced to take up corn farming to sustain his family of 2 kids of which, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) shares his zeal for science. Not surprisingly, she believes that her room has a ghost that is trying to reveal something to her and after a dust-storm fills it completely, signs pointing to coordinates of a secret location far from their home emerge and they take off in a quest to investigate. NASA, which had been shut down decades ago, still existed at that secret location with Professor Brand (Michael Caine). This is when it all gets interesting. Either Cooper figures a way to cultivate more crops to feed his kids and others or he executes the Plan A or B of Professor Brand that will take him close to Saturn's orbit where a wormhole will open paths to a possible new home for mankind. He prepares Cooper to confront the reality that the solution to man's problems may not be in our own solar system. That he had to leave it with a group of scientists on an Interstellar mission that would save mankind's future.Months and years go by as they journey to Saturn and subsequently into the other galaxy through the wormhole. Among the possible inhabitable planets that were named after the astronauts who discovered them was Miller, with its surface covered by shallow water. Due to its proximity to the Gargantua black hole, the gravitational pull caused time dilation that converted their hours on the planet to 23 Earth years. A seemingly shattered Cooper sits through the playback of all the messages he had received from his kids back on Earth in what could be among the most brilliantly directed emotional scenes with Matthew providing a deeply realistic performance sitting through the agony of his lost years. With fuel running low and vital mission time lost, the crew collectively choose to fly to Mann's icy planet which again had darkness of a different order. With an evil twist in their mission and a narrow escape from total devastation of the Endurance spacecraft, they subsequently go for Plan B on Edmunds' planet but with a stopover at Gargantua where TARS, the A.I. robot and Cooper separately launch into the black hole in a bid to learn about singularity. The dynamics of a strained relationship that resulted from a father's abrupt and uncertain departure from his beloved daughter carries through to adulthood and the coldness of Jessica Chastain's message to Cooper is where the audience invests at an emotional level. Mackenzie Foy portrays a distraught daughter who was left behind in a refreshingly natural manner. Anne Hathaway seems out of place and sidetracked sometimes. Michael Caine looks and sounds as he did in any of Nolan's films as he maintains his consistent sincerity that makes you just want to go along with his conviction in interstellar travel. Jessica Chastain is cold yet convincing. But it is the True Detective, Matthew McConaughey who is the soul of this film's powerful narrative. He not only portrays the more emotional aspects of being a father convincingly, but also showcases a strong, determined side of being an engineer in mind. Jonathan Nolan has always been a remarkable contribution to his brother's vision and while the brothers provided the much needed emotional edge, full of twists through the Interstellar journey, it couldn't have been as intriguing without the much needed collaboration with co-producer and space-time expert Kip Thorne. The film is ground-breaking cinema that takes the general audience through an inter-galactic journey that is overwhelmingly gorgeous in every scene. The terrifyingly large yet common haboobs, the space shuttle launch with the theater shaking sound, the journey through the wormhole, the tidal waves on Miller's planet, the frozen clouds on Mann's and the thrilling docking sequence on Endurance are dazzling visuals created by Double Negative's team. Then there's Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography ('Her'), that captures the raw beauty of an arid Earth during dust storms, the drone chase through corn fields, the vastness of Miller's water planet, the frigid conditions at Mann's planet and even sequences of just portraying the expressions of his actors. Add to it all, the inspiring score from Hans Zimmer brings back memories his best works.As much as Christopher Nolan would like to toy with your mind and fascinate you with the prospect of Interstellar travel, this is his most emotional and personal film. Nolan makes us pay attention to the simplified details his characters share about complex theories and he then rewards us with visuals of Endurance's journey through a wormhole, the emptiness of Gargantua and it's glowing rings, the wet and frozen planets and of course, the fifth dimension at event horizon. The film's 2hr 50 min duration doesn't seem as long even in Earth time and in the end, in his signature style of partly unraveled, partly withheld culmination of ideas, Christopher Nolan will leave you mentally suspended in his world like no other film maker can and you will still be discussing its plot elements days after Cooper's Interstellar journey. 9.410101 on a scale of 1-10.",Interstellar
368,tigerfish50,Sappy sentimentality and silly science,1/10,5 December 2014,"'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction.",Interstellar
369,MickeyTheConstant,Excellent Movie,10/10,22 July 2020,"Loved this movie. So so good. Special effects, acting, plot. Was really emotionally invested in it. I only have one gripe really and that is the main character's relationship with his son. He was so into his daughter but the son barely got a hug. Made me a bit mad. A minor gripe though for such a cool movie.

373,WubsTheFadger,Interstellar,9/10,4 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerI recently watched this movie on TV for the third time and just had to write a review for it. So here it is.First off, Christopher and Jonathon Nolan has created a complex and inspired story with some very powerful and emotional moments. The story is told slowing but in a way that makes us connect with the genuine and well made characters. The scientific side of the story can be hard to understand but after a second or third viewing everything becomes clear. The amount of foreshadowing and the plot twist are what make the film great. The story is powerful and is Nolan's 3rd best film (The Dark Knight is #1 and Memento is #2).The acting is amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his greatest performances ever. He bring such emotion and raw power to the screen. Jessica Chastain, David Gyasi, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all perform well. Anne Hathaway performs the worst. She is very bland and I have never been a fan of hers anyway.The pacing can seem slow to some, but the story takes its time to tell the story and introduce us to the science and the characters. The runtime is very long at a staggering 2 hours and 49 minutes long. But like I said, the story takes its time to develop ands keeps you involved.The CGI in the film is amazing. Space looks beautiful yet daunting. It looks peaceful yet terrifying.Pros: Inspired story, great use of foreshadowing and a great plot twist, emotional moments, complex science, amazing acting by Matthew McConaughey, good overall acting, good CGI, slow pacing in order to let the story develop, and a slightly unresolved endingCons: Anne Hathaway's dry performance, the pacing can be seen as slow and the runtime is very longOverall Rating: 9.2P.S. Much like Blade Runner 2049, the film takes its time to introduce the world and characters in a deep and complex way. Both films expect the audience to want to be involved in the process of telling the story.",Interstellar
374,mgruebel,"A nice homage to ""2001""",7/10,5 July 2015,"What would you put in a modern homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?-Docking to rotating space vehicle (for centrifugal gravity) with classical music? Check-Hibernation travel to an outer planet supervised by sentient machines? Check-An artificial 3-D environment constructed by aliens so humans can comprehend? Check-A device (here spherical, there rectangular) to transport us to said environment? Check-Colorful reflections on the hyperspace traveler's helmet during transport? Check-Explosion in an airlock while gaining access to a space ship? CheckThis was all far more visionary in 1968 than in 2014. Although not quite Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, Nolan and writers managed to construct quite a good homage, with a more personal story embedded in it than the 1968 classic. Taken completely by itself, the story is a bit trite, one might say at TV drama level, and this sinks the ticker to 8 stars out of 10 right there. It's a good story though, even if well-worn: a widowed father up against a choice to save the many, or to save his daughter. (His son is already beyond him to save, due to his own neglect.) Here, time travel through a wormhole adds the twist that a father must see his child die, but yet with another twist: she has lived much longer than he, and is surrounded by family and offspring. So her death is not tragic in the ""unfulfilled life"" sense that a child's death is usually tragic. It is more like a reversal of the parent-child role at the deathbed.The many-dimensions-rolled-into-three artificial environment, so the space-faring father can comprehend, turns out to be created by our descendants from a far future. Fine. It seems that they should have been able to place both wormhole entrances near an ordinary G- or K-class star like our sun, instead of mostly uninhabitable planets near an exotic black hole. Somewhat of a story-ending plot hole. Still fine. But the silly ""happy ending,"" where dad flies after his love interest, who is seeding humans near the black hole, definitely is pure Hollywood. Another star off, to 7/10. Where Spielberg's ""AI"" should have ended when the ferris wheel fell on the AI boy as he saw the Fairie Godmother, this film should have ended with dad walking down the hospital hallway alone as his daughter dies of old age, rather than dad hi-jacking a spaceship from a secure facility and flying to the damsel in distress.The performances are solid and suitably under-played, and the actors and Nolan deserve a lot of credit for that. For otherwise the TV drama aspect would win out over the grand setting. Michael Caine is a nice celebrity cameo touch as the physicist who lures the film's hero with ""Plan A,"" but really believes that only the much less pleasant ""Plan B"" will work out. Nolan and Caine must have gotten on well on ""Batman.""7/10 is a nice film, and this is well acted, well directed, well set-designed, well CGId and generally well written. Definitely a film to see again, although I think history will not judge it as highly as the kind IMDb user ratings.",Interstellar
375,Semisonic,"Monumental, but lazy, stumbling and ultimately confused about its own message",7/10,17 March 2015,"Now, months after Interstellar hit the screens and days after it got its home media release, one can already start summing up the impact this movie made. It may not have caught up with Nolan's other top products like The Dark Knight and Inception in terms of ratings and popularity yet, but it's already obvious that Interstellar was his attempt to make even a bigger bang. The longest of Nolan's movies so far, Interstellar sends us to a humankind-saving journey across the Universe, at the same time putting to test everything that we are used to calling humanity.This movie was simply bound to be monumental. Taking into account Nolan's love for complex plots oversaturated with details and the premise of galactic scale, we could expect a spectacle which only Kubrick dared to stage before in his 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet Nolan doesn't simply call his bet, he raises it, putting the fate of the human race itself on the table. And since it's not 1968 anymore and Christopher Nolan has no shortage of either money or technology, one thing is for sure - that Interstellar is as visually stunning as films can be today.Now that was an obligatory piece of praise since one cannot deny Interstellar the merits mentioned above. And, of course, for some audience those merits will be enough, since it's not so difficult to imagine people who get all orgasmic from any high-budget sci-fi film or run in circles yelling ""Spaceship! Spaceship! Spaceship!"". But, truth to be told, not all is perfect in the glossy Nolan kingdom.And i'm not even talking about the counter-scientific statements this movie makes. After all, any good science fiction at some point has to venture out into the unknown, with only the author's imagination to guide it per aspera ad astra. What i'm talking about is the quite earthly ground this movie is based on. And it is obvious that even the best spacecraft would have a hard time lifting off if the ground beneath it isn't solid.Just a quick glimpse into this topic, since i don't wanna turn a review into a bashing. A piece of dialogue:You're a well-educated man, Coop.And a trained pilot. And an engineer.Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers. We didn't run out of television screens and planes. We ran out of food.How do you like it? This is supposed to be a futuristic world, where the apex of human technology is in the past and the dwindled humankind is striving for food by engaging in manual labor. Yet we are told that engineers, the salt of the modern earth who can automate just about anything, including the food production, are not needed anymore. Because the bosses are happier with people driving tractors than with people knowing how to make machines do the job. After that, the logical consistence of the movie takes a nosedive and never straightens itself. Blight that breathes nitrogen, which somehow leads to the decrease of oxygen. Making the whole space station spin for two years simply to make the crew feel some gravity for a few minutes before they go to hiber-sleep. And so on, and so on.But Interstellar's worst is not being handicapped about displaying the technical stuff. It is trying to add a deeper, more humane message to the film, yet being handicapped at that too. Here, people do not simply save mankind from its demise. They proclaim love, yes, love as a driving force of evolution, a not yet fully understood mechanism of survival of the species, the only thing besides gravity that can pierce through space and time, etc. And this hippie ""love is the answer"" nonsense is served with a dead serious face from people who only seconds ago were talking formulas and science.Well, okay, if love is the answer then at least show us that love. Instead, we have a protagonist, a father of two children, whose only motivation is to come back home and save them. Yet for some reason he only really cares about his daughter, totally ignoring his son, as if he doesn't matter simply because he didn't throw a fit when his dad left them for a space mission. Moreover, his son is even displayed in the film as some sort of a bad guy, simply because he allowed himself to feel abandoned (as he actually was). Even when Coop returns back to people, he doesn't even ask a single question about his son. Now that's a true father's love that saved the world, no sh*t.Still, Interstellar does have its powerful moments. Maybe the best one is the story of Dr. Mann (Matt Damon), which showed how people are actually unwilling to die, even if the fate of humankind depends on it, even if they knew beforehand that it might be a part of the plan, even if they devised that plan themselves. Once again, it proves that the most emotional yield is given by the stories in which a man's nemesis is a man himself. Too bad that Interstellar much often prefers to shows us battles with lifeless things like time and gravity.Despite its flaws, Interstellar is a very enjoyable high-quality product. Unfortunately, the word ""product"" describes it better than ""art"". Like those fancy rectangular robots, it is shiny, useful and sometimes even funny. But still ultimately soulless.",Interstellar
376,Come-and-Review,Interstellar: a space odyssey,10/10,16 November 2014,"First of all I want to remind that this movie is completely different from any previous Nolan movie I've seen, exception for a few solutions of storytelling Nolan uses frequently.Nolan himself admitted this movie is inspired both by Tarkovskij's Mirror and Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, and I must say that last title's influence is very evident throughout the entire movie, full with references, without that downgrading this movie at all. I saw myself some references in Solaris (1972) too. The movie, if you didn't expect, is a slow movie. it has some deep messages, most of which told by the characters, and has incredibly well done visual effects. Each actor's performance was great, starting from McConaughney, Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine, to Matt Damon's cameo, strangely uncredited though of its own importance in the movie. The music of Hans Zimmer surprised me completely, even though was said to be original and new. It has nothing to do with Zimmer's previous scores, and in certain points reminds of 2001: A space odyssey.I can see, strangely, how this movie's direction was originally thought to be given to Spielberg; certain scenes give that thrilling fear that Spielberg uses in his own movies, though storytelling and the way the entire film is shot does not resemble Spielberg's way of direction at all.I come back to the visual effects. They were stunning, just as the ideas and concepts that have been put in this movie. This movie, as I already said, is very clearly inspired by 2001, but is less enigmatic and maybe more adapted to present audiences. It does have more science than 2001, more deepness of the message than 2001, and, to me, it's what 2001 should have been, not taking away respect to the movie that is considered by me the founder of the Science Fiction as a true, modern cinematic genre. I'd give a 11/10 to this movie if I only could!!!",Interstellar
377,csm-78119,Ambitious Sci Fi Epic,7/10,17 July 2020,"There are some interesting ideas and some great moments in this original piece of work.

It's ambition together with some decent performances along the way elevate it into the above average bracket.

379,stephendaxter,"Amazingly beautiful, emotional and compelling",9/10,15 November 2014,"Firstly, this film to put it simply is beautiful, the visuals in this movie are spectacular and truly amazing at all times. As well as being impressive visually, it is also an emotional story exploring father-daughter relationships that really gets the audience invested in the characters and gets them to really feel what the characters themselves are going through at different stages of this film. Plot wise the film is very strong and compelling right from the very beginning to the final seconds, being a Christopher Nolan film. Now to the negatives because it is not a perfect film, i think one thing that it suffered from was asking a lot of the audience. There are times in this film where lots of information is being thrown at the audience and at times it is almost too much to try to understand what just happened and pay attention to what is happening now. Also I feel that the film was a little too long and around 20 minutes could have been cut out from the middle without losing a whole lot of information. So in the end Interstellar is another fantastically beautiful, emotional and compelling work by Nolan that slightly suffers in runtime and quite a bit of exposition.

380,asage19,"Pretty good, but wasted opportunity",7/10,26 July 2020,"I gave it a 7, because I find some of the relationship dynamics in the movie to be an unnecessary irritation. The movie could have been a masterpiece without the histrionics. Maybe they just didn't ring true, or maybe they didn't add much to the story. Maybe (in the case of the daughter) it was just so much negative-feeling bunk that really distracted. It's too damned bad. This is a large-canvas film and it was diminished. I *think* that's because instead of infusing our characters with some nobility, we were treated to whining, and supposed realistic human behaviour. I gotta say, if you're aiming high, don't sabotage your attempt with the low human characteristics. Give us something to feel good about. This movie seems to be about people attaining their goal despite being 'merely human'. Darned shame, wasted opportunity. I felt irritated often, throughout the movie and didn't feel like cheering, at the end. Great cast, though. Even Matthew McConaughey had his more irritating acting twitches reigned in by Christopher Nolan's directing skill.

381,Breumaster,"""Interstellar"" is in my personal Top-Ten-List!",10/10,9 November 2014,"Not just an space-adventure. Insterstellar is so much more about human beings and taking chances, and good decisions under bad conditions. It's about love and despair. I can not tell anymore without spoiling, so the rest of my review is about things like cut, cinematography and so on. And the cut is perfect! Switching between earth and space-scenes would destroy nearly any movie in it's flow, but with the continuity of the perfect score through this scenes, it doesn't break the storyline. It goes hand in hand showing what happens simultaniously. And that shows great dramatics. Great done! The story is one of the best i've seen so far. The cinematographer did very good shots through the entire movie. The actors did great work! Looks like another Oscar for McConaughey. The score is perfectly supporting the atmosphere. There is no reason for me to give less than 10/10. And that's nearly an insult! OK, here is one point in which the movie could be better ... it should be 240 minutes long, not only 169 minutes. ;))) Greetings. :)",Interstellar

384,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Not stellar,5/10,12 November 2014,"The Earth is dying. Wormhole appears leading to potential new planets to colonise. Ex-pilot farmer finds secret facility and is immediately put in charge of the mission. Now, the obvious but not primary complaint revolves around the fact there are (already viable) options to escape a dying Earth that are much easier to accomplish. Terraforming Mars? Yes! It would even take less time to set up an initial colony than this. Actually fighting the (never ever explained) crops' blight? We have genetic engineering, you know. We don't get to go extinct because of drought. More importantly, the entire plot of the movie leads to the launching of a space station. Already built, but on the ground, so it couldn't be launched - now, call me crazy, but building a space station, even a colossal, much bigger than this one, is an infinitely better option than crossing galaxies to find out how to get this one off the ground. I think the film tries to explain this away with ""we are working in secret, people wouldn't support the space programme"". This is wrong in a million ways, from the fact that secretly building habitable space stations can't be harder than sending secret missions to travel through a wormhole around Saturn, to ""people should have probably realised the world is ending so hey, THEY JUST MIGHT SEE THE LOGIC HERE"", with a stop in ""who cares what they think, we never intend to save them anyway"". Not to mention I can't quite get how and why they sent the initial missions without the potential of returning - it would save a lot of time to just send them through, check the planets and return. And yes, that would be a better option even if you only consider ""Plan B"".HOWEVER, this isn't the main problem. These are passable holes that can be accepted in favour of a compelling story. And that kind of happens, until the final part of the movie where our protagonist enters a black hole in another galaxy and voila, just like we feared from the beginning of the film, gets back home without reason, explanation, or a semblance of logic. We actually hear something like ""love will help us transmit data from inside the event horizon to earth"". There are limits to what you can get away with, and Nolan crosses the event horizon right about there. Add to that the fact that visiting the planet close to the black hole first instead of leaving it as a last option is by all accounts a ridiculous decision, although I do understand that it's dramatically very useful and actually helps plot and character development.Visually, the film has its moments - but they are less than I had hoped. The journey through the wormhole and in the black hole are superb. So is the visual representation of the 5-D (?) library - if you can look past how Cooper gets there. But the planets visited are not particularly memorable. The dying Earth is just a sad rural landscape. The new human society is a suburban torus where you look outside the window to see the surviving human race (a couple of thousand Americans by the look of it)...playing baseball. The main idea of the film isn't bad. The execution is severely lacking. The expectation-result equilibrium isn't great.I do give a point for the use of Dylan Thomas, a fabulous poem that fits into the story wonderfully. Let's remember this, if anything, from Interstellar, for when our species faces great adversity: We must not go gentle into that good night.",Interstellar

386,gcsman,Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece,10/10,30 December 2017,"I'll say a number of things about Interstellar but basically ... words fail me. This is one h*** of a movie. Even though it has some flaws, or at least certain things that bother me a bit, I find this film so absorbing from start to finish that I just can't resist giving it 10/10. Big-screen, big ideas, big-budget, terrific technology, a script that's not dumbed down, and a stacked cast. And the run time of almost 3 hours has not a single wasted minute -- it's not at all too long for its seamlessly interlocked plot to unfold. Everything is here -- gut-wrenching personal tragedies and triumphs, visual spectacle like nothing before, high drama, inspirational striving against huge odds, and all delivered by actors in total command. If you don't read any further, I hope this is already enough to persuade you to see it (or see it again!).TIFF was playing both Interstellar and 2001: A Space Odyssey this past month so I went in to see it in their beautiful theater space again, three years after its first release. The pro critics would see 2001 (from 1968) as its logical predecessor, and to some extent it certainly is. But it also owes a lot to 2010: The Year We Make Contact (from 1984) in its pure and accurate depiction of space travel. (As one example, take the sequence in Interstellar showing their arrival at Saturn, and compare it with 2010's arrival at Jupiter and the atmospheric braking technique. Both are visually magnificent.) But there are things in Interstellar that are entirely its own, such as the scenes of the black hole with accretion disk, its NON-singular center (a nonrotating black hole has a singular point of infinite density at its center, but a spinning black hole actually does not!), the stretching of time in a strong gravitational field, and the outside view of the wormhole with its gravitationally lensed images of galaxies on the far side. During the production it became well known that Nolan was (intelligently) relying on consultation with Kip Thorne, a theoretical astrophysicist and specialist in gravity and spacetime, and it showed. Maybe Thorne didn't get an Oscar for this work, but I'm sure he'll make do with his Nobel Prize. :) There's so much here that is done right, all the way down to the simple fact that the views outside the various spacecraft are utterly silent no matter if their thrusters are firing or they are colliding -- sound doesn't exist in a vacuum, period. The cast list is just amazing: Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, and a wonderful Mackenzie Foy as 10-year-old ""Murph"" (under certain camera angles and lighting, she and Chastain as her older self look uncannily alike). Every one of them has an essential role to play in this rich and complex script. Also worth noting: thankfully it's becoming common enough now for a woman scientist to play a major role in SF and other films, but it's still very rare to have MORE than one. Here we've got both Hathaway (biologist) and Chastain (physicist), and their characters are both key players and heroes in their own right. And the advanced-AI robots on the spacecraft are predictably charming, but thankfully do NOT steal the show. This is an ensemble cast all the way through.Hans Zimmer's musical score is quite distinctive, even for him. I particularly liked the elegant dance-like motif that accompanies spacecraft travel scenes among others -- it's a gently soaring, yearning line of song that just ... never... quite ... resolves or comes to rest. On the other hand, he has a couple of suitably massive themes for the big dramatic buildups that pack a real punch.OK, for the things that bothered me a bit:the 'tesseract library' at the center of the black hole and the transmission of signals across time by manipulating gravity: I know it's ingenious, but it is just a bit hard to swallow. I keep wondering if there was a better way to do this, but I'll admit I can't think of one.the ships would have been ripped apart going into the black hole; the tidal field around a stellar-mass b.h. is too steep for anything solid to maintain its structure.with Earth's resources dwindling and monoculture crops catastrophically failing one after the other, how come everyone still drives cars and trucks everywhere? Where is the gas coming from?These are quibbles though. The powerful storyline and first rate production quality trump everything else. A modern classic.",Interstellar

388,troy-manatunga,The total experience is more immersive.,8/10,8 November 2014,"For a man with just ten movies of directorial involvement under his belt and to make the A-List of directors in Hollywood Christopher Nolan surely has his bearings placed right. Known for his anarchic works since his indie days of MEMENTO all the way to blockbuster ring leaders such as the BATMAN trilogy, Christopher Nolan always has proved to be gaining of his game. As the mediocre summer blockbuster season of 2014 sets in the horizon the winter opens to the exhilarating and much anticipated Nolan venture into the genre of Sci-Fi ; INTERSTELLAR.Starring Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey as Cooper; an ex test pilot for NASA, an engineer and an old fashioned farmer the earth is struggling for survival. Set In the near future, the earth is deteriorating its self. The soil that cultivated our crops is the very thing that is destroying it. Food is scarce and the likelihood of famine and the earth surviving yet another generation on its own seems bleak. Whilst it isn't an instant apocalyptic setting it is a probable slow extinction scenario. Cooper a good father and persistent farmer alongside Donald (John Lithgow) do his best to raise his two children Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Supernatural circumstances much like in Mel Gibson's SIGNS results in Cooper and Murph being lead to specific coordinates that happen to be an area 51 of some sorts. Convenient enough the facility is home for some of the brightest minds on the planet and does happen to house a space ship that is being built for space travel as a final desperate effort of earth's survival. The ingenuity (intended sarcasm) of the screenplay is such that the Nolan brothers also conveniently placed Coopers mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) in the board of directors of sorts within the same facility and Cooper without hesitation is offered the job to pilot the ship out into space.. just like that. A bit rushed this all seems and way way way too convenient in choosing the commanding pilot for the mission one would say. Let me leave that minor detail as it is for spitting into the wind isn't that smart since the rest of the movie is just astounding and McConaughey easily secures a nomination at the 2015 Academy Awards with this stellar (I had to say this) performance.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan efforts in taking the genre of sci-fi to a new level deserve a nod. Whilst GRAVITY was ridiculously overrated in 2013 it is safe to place bets on INTERSTELLAR as a winter winner this year. Wormholes, Black holes, Time and space relativity theories will shatter your mind in the efforts of trying to draw sensible parallels. Theories of another life, theories of time travel, theories of quantum physics that are blatantly profound to the untrained movie enthusiast will keep you wincing at intervals trying to make sense of the practicality of what is right in front of your eyes. Deciphering the plot may look Childs play to the Sheldon Coopers (I had to say this too) of the audience but still it will mesmerize the penny's just as much through its ethereal CGI and 70mm IMAX (if available). One of the personal favorites of INTERSTELLAR is that never has space in this detail been part of plot. Yes – GRAVITY did sell a cleverly imagined plot that takes place ""in"" space but INTERSTELLAR details a plot that takes place ""inside"" of space. For those that cannot fathom the school of thought will surely see what I mean once you're done watching – The total experience is more immersive.Walking in for a Nolan film sets ones expectations to an auto setting of high. Enthralling and entertaining it is. At nearly three hours there is never a dull moment but just variance in the pace of progress. However it is safe to admit that INTERSTELLAR can never be placed on par with the works of INCEPTION. Still to the fans of Nolan, to the fans of the Genre and most importantly to the fans of good taste in movies this movie will serve you right. It will surely intrigue. TITLE: INTERSTELLAR DIRECTED BY: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN STARRING: MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, ANNA HATHAWAY, JESSICA CHASTAIN, MATT DAMON, JOHN LITHGOW, David OYELOWO & MICHAEL CAIN RATED: PG 13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 165 MINUTES",Interstellar
389,CMTiago,A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans,8/10,16 April 2015,"As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10",Interstellar
390,Spartan_1_1_7,Nolan's Most Ambitious Project Yet.,9/10,22 November 2014,"""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again. This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father- Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too. Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded. Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets. The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end. Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer on screen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years. 9.5/10",Interstellar
391,merrywood,Sorry but I march to a different drum.,5/10,12 November 2014,"It is not just the impossible science in the script, for example; the fact that a gravity sufficient to slow down time by a factor of 60,000 (one hour equals seven years) would make it impossible to land a ship using our known technology. It would instantly crush the vehicle along with its crew. Not major but contributory, the title itself, ""Interstellar"" is a misnomer since the lead character travels beyond dimensions, not just between stars.The script begins to fall apart when it is actually less than half way through. By the end, it is out of control and wildly bizarre. The intelligence alluded to as ""they"" is far too nebulous and ranges into incoherence. A murky plot and the use of often-mumbled tech-babble move it all to the realm of the juvenile scenario. As a literary device, the use of babble instead of coherent language is as silly as Bugs Bunny pulling a large hammer from behind his back, out of nowhere.The scene where Coop finally meets his daughter, Murph, as an old woman was touching, but the casting of the highly recognizable Ellen Burstyn, albeit, a wonderful actor was, however, inappropriate since it tends to destroy suspension of disbelief.Those critics that do not wish it revealed that they do not understand it will give it rave reviews in order to convince others that they do understand it. Some of the audience will go the same way. Such is our contemporary Hollywood scenario.",Interstellar
392,iguth,A spiritual successor to 2001,9/10,27 April 2019,"Interstellar is in my opinion Matthew McConaughey's best film. This movie serves as a spiritual successor to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It takes the audience on a journey through space implementing real science into the mix. The emotional struggle between Murph and a father that she doesn't see most of her life is so incredibly touching and well done. I cried 3 times at different points purely because of the emotions felt by Cooper and Murph. Stunning visuals, amazing concept, and an ending that is complex enough that half of the audience doesn't really understand. I love that

393,michaelhirakida,An Honest Review: Its Just Good.,7/10,7 November 2014,"I will try to keep this review spoiler free.Christopher Nolan has many followers and haters. Personally, I thoroughly enjoy his films and he knows how to play with peoples emotions in movies like Inception and The Dark Knight. Interstellar is his latest movie and it already is in the Top 25 on IMDb's Top 250 list. But is it really that amazing? No. But it still will leave you satisfied as a crowd pleasing experience.Basically, Earth is going to die. So Pilot/Farmer Cooper and a team of astronauts go through a wormhole to find a new planet. But time is precious and the world is aging.First the big problem I had just to get off my chest was the sound mixing. While most of the film has no problems. A loud rumbling can be heard (from what I experienced seeing it in 35mm film) in the last quarter of the film which makes some of the dialog inaudible. Even when the actors are screaming, you can barely hear them because of this noise. But anyways...The film has a bit of comic sense that sometimes lacks in Nolan's films. But because of the content, you will need some cheering up with comic relief characters. Bill Irwin as the voice of Tars is great and at first glance looks silly as a robot, but you come to love this character bringing unexpected depth to him.The visuals are outstanding. Like with Inception, Interstellar has some great and realistic visuals to help believe that we are actually in space including some that are very surreal.The movie is more complex then his Dark Knight Films mostly due to the fact that there are many themes of space exploration and theories about black holes including an ending that will sure be a head twister.Everyone did amazing especially Anne Hathaway in her Second Nolan film appearance including Matt Damon in a role I will not spoil. This is what I personally think as not a Fan-boy or a hater. See it for yourself to judge. A few minutes could have been trimmed due to pacing but anyways let me finish this review off.Interstellar is not the best Nolan Film. But it definitely is a crowd pleasing movie that has amazing visuals, great acting and a good story. I saw this in 35MM film but see it in 70MM IMAX if it is playing near you. You will not regret it.78/100 B",Interstellar

395,schroeder-gustavo,Came close to being Nolan's masterpiece,8/10,30 June 2015,"Christopher Nolan's space opera has the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie. Yes, even better than Gravity, and that is saying something. The CGI in this movie really is praise-worthy since I find myself telling myself something that rarely happens: It looked 100% real. Everything in this movie from the black hole to the worm hole looks incredible and the you can't really even notice the CGI. The score by Hans Zimmer is amazing, of course; and some scenes show director Christopher Nolan at his most mature.Interstellar could have been spectacular, and it came close, really close to being the best movie directed by Chris Nolan, but there's no way around it, the movie is flawed. Like I said earlier the visuals and the sound are amazing, the directing was great, but the sad thing is, the story has issues. Just a few things off the top of my head: Cooper doesn't give a crap about his son and it just feels like he could have been completely left out of the movie and it wouldn't matter; two, the entire last act feels like Nolan takes us by the hand and shows us what he would like it to be his ""perfect ending"", but it all just feels too ""perfect"", which makes it imperfect, if that makes any sense at all; the whole love is quantifiable thing, really? She's a top scientist on a secret NASA mission and she's saying love is quantifiable?; Also in the end when Murph sees her dad for the first time in decades, and even after the entire human race pretty much owes him that they're all still alive, she talks to him for like two minutes and then asks him to leave? Really?There were many things I really liked about Interstellar, though. Some of those things are the special effects, score and directing of the movie, like I mentioned earlier, but another thing I liked is how Christopher Nolan tries to pay homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which I think he achieves through some aspects. Like the spinning space station and the black hole sequence is more or less like the sequence of Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite in 2001. I also loved the chemistry between Coop and Murph when he's still on Earth.Interstellar is not a perfect movie, by any means. But it is still a very well made film that has a few issues, but still doesn't disappoint and adds another victory to Christopher Nolan's amazing resume as a film director.",Interstellar
396,jmillerdp,Metaphysical Journey More Than Intergalactic Journey,9/10,14 September 2015,"While classified as Science Fiction, ""Interstellar"" is much more about its characters than it is about outer space.Co-Writer/Director Christopher Nolan has a very antiseptic approach to film. His movies have a clinical, clean room feel to them. So, emotions in his films often fall to the background.And, because of that, I often feel that I am being kept at arm's length by his films. But, what makes ""Interstellar"" work are the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey. He gives a great performance that could have easily gained him another Best Actor Oscar if this weren't a Science-Fiction film.The other actors also do a great job, and that's what makes the film work. There is a lot of science to absorb, and I am sure that could be challenging for those who don't watch Science Channel's space- programming block every week!But, it is the characters, and the performances that carry the movie. When you get to the end, that's where I choked up. And, it was because of that. The story has lots of good stuff in it, but that isn't why you care about what happens.Hans Zimmer delivers yet another excellent film score! He is probably the one great film composer working today, besides John Williams, whose work is legendary.********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)",Interstellar
397,jake-law123,"Good, not great.",7/10,28 December 2014,"I definitely went into this film expecting to love it, because I am such a Nolan fan. Also just by looking at it you can tell it was made to be great. In the end, I still enjoyed it, but I was slightly disappointed, expecting a tad more. It was nowhere near as disappointed as The Dark Knight Rises, but I felt like it was missing something.The story tells of astronauts going on a secret NASA mission to travel to a wormhole in space to a different galaxy in order to find a habitable planet for humanity, which is in danger of being killed off. McConaughey is a farmer/scientific engineer who finds the secret NASA mission with the help of his almost equally smart daughter. Like most Nolan screenplays, it's extremely scientific and complex. I'd argue this one goes a little over his head, he's trying Way too hard to be smart.The chemistry between McConaughey and his daughter is easily the best part about this film. His ability to cry gets me choked up every time, though he can do much more than that. Combine that with a weeping daughter, and you got a tear jerker. McConaughey does an amazing acting job in this one, he's just so likable all around. The rest of the performances are nice, but the character development is sloppy at times, or it's being distracted by scientific exposition.This is easily his weakest film, aside from being too scientific, it's just not as creative or imaginative as his Inception, or as realistically interesting like The Dark Knight. He just gets so lost in his Nolan mode that he just goes with whatever. I will say the plot near the end is set up very well, even if it does drag on a tad. This film could have easily been 2 hours or a little more. It did not have to be 3. So much of the film could have been trimmed.I enjoyed it as a whole, but it's one of the weaker films I've seen this year. It's still Nolan so it doesn't suck or anything, it gets by, but that's about it. For what I was expecting, I was wanting more, for what I got, I would still recommend it highly.",Interstellar
398,rprince-832-6294,It's great! But is it 2001: A Space Odyssey?....,8/10,7 November 2014,"-Interstellar is the next big film from Christopher Nolan. Future Earth is running out of food and Matthew McConaughey must lead an exploration into a black hole in space to another galaxy to save humanity. (I will not be able to say much about the film's plot without spoiling anything.) Before I saw it, I thought it could be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey. I will say whether I was right or not at the end....-So Interstellar is hard to judge, but I loved a lot of it. It had its flaws, but I loved a lot more than I disliked. So yeah.-The story was pretty good, original, and solid. It had some twists and some great moments in it! It also had a few things that didn't make sense of come around to resolution at the end.-The pace was okay. It had some pretty slow moments for a 3 hour film. Also it was 3 hours and could have been a little shorter.-The tone was great. It explored themes of humanity, space, time, love, and a lot of relativity. It also had some kinda essential themes where were eh.-The acting was good. McConaughey did a great job and this it my new favorite role for him! However, if you don't like the actor, you won't like him in this. Anne Hathaway did great! Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all did a great job! However, I HATE Topher Grace because he reminds me of Spider-Man 3 and his lack of acting sills.-The effects were mind-blowing. Kinda like 2001.... Should they beat Apes for best effects? Idk. Gravity just won, so probably not. However, there are some visually stunning effects that make it soooooo worth it!-The music was fantastic!! Hans Zimmer's original score offered so much to the film and it would have been a different ride without him. I hope he wins an Oscar for it. No joke.-There were a few editing choices I wasn't fond of. But then came to appreciate. And a few moments where I thought ""You'd better explain this"" and then they did. Nolan covered more based in this than The Dark Knight Rises.-One thing I hated but can't hold against the film was the aspect ratio. It went from regular to IMAX to regular a lot and I noticed. It was inevitable though. No hard feelings -Content: It is PG-13 for some intense sequences and some language.-I think that's it.... So Interstellar has its flaws, but it's still fantastic! I walked out very satisfied with a lot to think about! I will say Interstellar is EASILY worth seeing in theaters! Or 3D. Or IMAX. Twice. I really need to see it again to just anything more. I don't know where is falls in my Top 100 or Top 10 for the year yet. I will post that when I decide. So for now, I am going to give Interstellar a VERY high 8.5/10 to be safe.-Was it 2001: A Space Odyssey? It was not as good, no. However, I will say it is as good as we are going to get. Both are visually stunning and explore deep themes of humanity and space/time while offering captivating sequences!",Interstellar
399,grumpy-3,overblown/overlong/overrated,1/10,10 November 2014,"His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover.",Interstellar
400,perica-43151,"Many plot-holes but a solid work of sci-fi overall, with some worthy moments",8/10,5 November 2019,"First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority.",Interstellar

402,caseynicholson,A Well Made Film that Fails to be Likable,6/10,22 November 2014,"It's taken me a few days since seeing ""Interstellar"" in the theater to be able to digest it enough to sit down and write out this review. It's a long movie with a lot going on, and it leaves the viewer with a lot to think about. This is good inasmuch as the plot is intriguing and engaging. However, while the plot of the film was engaging, the big question that I left the theater with was ""Did I like this movie?"" And that's a question that I've not yet really been able to answer affirmatively.Without writing a spoiler review, let me say that I had read several Facebook and Twitter comments which compared the film to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". I tried to ignore those comments and not let them color my take on the film, but the simple truth is that ""Interstellar"" does borrow somewhat heavily from ""2001""--albeit subtly. ""Interstellar"" is stylistically a very different film from Kubrick's masterpiece. Whereas ""2001"" is an abstract and mind numbing sci-fi film that blends cinema and the visual arts , ""Interstellar"" is much more of a drama film that happens to be set in space. That said, though, anyone who has ever seen ""2001"" will quickly note the similarity in its basic aspects and the journey that Matthew McConaughey undergoes. At times, it's hard to know whether ""Interstellar"" is attempting to not-so-subtly nod to ""2001"" (such as the use of cryogenic hibernation, a trip to an anomaly near a planet in our solar system, a trip beyond the anomaly that ultimately leads to a strange and fascinating place, etc.), or if the film is simply plagiarizing Kubrick. At other times it's impossible not to compare the film to that other Matthew McConaughey movie with space-time travel, ""Contact"". One might even say that ""Interstellar"" is a stylistic amalgamation of those two films.What this amounts to is an extraordinary tale of a space mission replete with both action, suspense, and a dramatic back story. What is less sure, however, is how well all of these elements come together into an enjoyable movie going experience. As noted, there's not a lot of new material here. Even if the back story is somewhat unique in its own right, it's nevertheless a dystopian tale of an alternate future that leads to a dramatic journey that has been done in other films. On top of that, the film is a bit exhausting--it clocks in at 2 hours and 49 minutes, and while that time is well used, it's also a very overwhelming film that drags one's attention in all sorts of emotional directions, all while engaging complex topics such as climate change, apocalypticism and relativity. Taking all of that into account, I've decided that I'm less enthused with ""Interstellar"" than I hoped I might be. The film stands on its own two feet as a good film overall. It's well made, and it has an all star cast with good acting throughout. And yet it fails on the likability factor and borrows heavily from films that came before it. Thus my 6/10 stars.",Interstellar
403,RIK-22,"It's a Chris Nolan film. All style, but no substance.",1/10,19 March 2015,"As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies.",Interstellar
404,Condemned-Soul,"Thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, and thematically powerful, 'Interstellar' is Christopher Nolan's finest achievement: an epic sci-fi masterpiece.",10/10,31 October 2020,"It's set in a future in which crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival, and follows a group of astronauts on a daring mission to enter a wormhole in the hopes of finding a new home for mankind...Nolan crafts something memorable with 'Interstellar'; a film that takes its ambitious central theme of love and creates a profound story around it, simultaneously huge and intimate in scope: the unshakeable bond between father and child that literally saves the human race. And it's executed to perfection, with a metaphysical finale that stays true to this theme at the cost of perhaps dividing the audience. But it works, and it's very emotional and powerful.Matthew McConaughey delivers a career-best performance as Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot who is drawn into mankind's greatest endeavour. He's an explorer who doesn't belong on a dying planet, and he's destined for the stars. McConaughey brings all the emotion required to help sell his character's actions. The hopes and dreams of a future rest on Cooper's shoulders, and he's constantly tested throughout in perilous situations that have dire repercussions for himself and others; and he's unwaveringly faithful to his tenets and his children.'Interstellar' masterfully sets up its crucial mission, and it delivers all kinds of feelings that stem from real-world concerns surrounding fate and choice. The existential elements are always at the forefront of the script, and once the film throws us into the vast vacuum of space it elicits feelings of awe and dread in equal measure.This is aided by sensational special effects that are as scientifically accurate as possible. The ominous emptiness of a black hole, the swirling unknown that encompasses a wormhole, the sheer terror felt from a wave hundreds of feet high... 'Interstellar' is just visually stunning throughout, and there's innumerable other examples that corroborate this.It's breathtaking to behold, but it's also memorable in the sound department too. Hans Zimmer produces one of the greatest scores ever committed to film; a grand soundscape of wonder, beauty and eeriness that's a separate emotional experience all in itself. Paired with the memorable imagery, the music is enough to give you chills, particularly in its strongest narrative moments - of which there are many.Overall, 'Interstellar' is simply breathtaking. Never has a film evoked such monumental feelings in me like this science fiction adventure has. From the screenplay, to the performances, to the visuals, to the music... everything just clicks into place like it was meant to be. It's an extraordinary experience, it's perfection - and it remains my favourite film.10/10",Interstellar
405,freshclean-66-318608,Very Deep.,7/10,14 June 2015,"Someone who's not interested in or have a basic knowledge of things like the theory of relativity or knowing about the space time continuum probably wouldn't find this film fun to watch unless you were looking at the film from a dramatic standpoint. All around, I think, this was a good film to watch for both reasons, scientific and dramatic. This film has a top billed cast working on it which I think helped it a little too. At some points this film reminded me of ""Contact"", not because of Matthew McConaughey, and ""Event Horizon"" especially when Romilly (David Gyasi) was explaining to Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) how traveling through a wormhole works. Towards the end of the film when Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) goes through a black hole and ends up where he ends up, that was a little far-fetched but it did tie in good with the film, other than that it was very interesting to watch.",Interstellar

I am a fan somewhat, but I also get a bit ""down"" when it comes to thinking about the endless of the universe and our ultimate fate, dying. I have always watched such movies with great anticipation but always felt a bit bad in the end, thinking all of this. Well, this movie had it all. It was about a really really serious problem, the actual fatality of the entire human race. What can be worse than that? I enjoyed the acting of all actors involved with no exceptions. Matthew McConaughey is ""on fire"" for a couple of years now and he just picked it up from there. It was an amazing performance. The concept was so nice and interesting, the script was awesome and the way it was presented it was so captivating that I found myself wanting the movie to continue so that I would see what will happen with Mathew and the astronaut-lady! It seemed too long a movie, but with all the storyline being firm and exciting, it really did not feel like that long, despite the fact that it was. The ending was a bit difficult to come in terms with and consider it plausible, but in the end it was one of these nice endings that you come to appreciate. The power of the final scenes of the movie was actually immense. Seeing his daughter at this age, talking to her and touching her, was really really breathtaking. It was a movie to remember and I do hope that there could be a way for a sequel and then a prequel, etc. Many things are left unexplained about how we reached that point. It could be a prequel... Just throwing the idea out there... Overall, a movie that challenges your intellect, your basic instincts, everything. It's a must-see movie folks...",Interstellar
407,cdjh-81125,Not Nolans Best but Still One Hell of A Film,8/10,24 June 2016,"Despite the fact that I adore Christopher Nolan I just wasn't a huge fan of the trailers as I don't really like realistic space movies but this and 2015s The Martian have turned me as I though this was a fantastic movie even if it doesn't quite live up against Nolans other movies. I will be honest though the first time I watched it I wasn't a huge fan but this is definitely a movie that gets better and better with repeat viewings. But Nolans fingerprints are all over this it has an incredibly intriguing plot that is fully explored that was one if my worries watching this movie that it wasn't going to realise it's full potential but it did and made Interstellar very intriguing and smart. This film is directed beautifully there's no need for constant cuts and movement sometimes you just need to let the actors act and that's exactly what Nolan did. The space sequences in this movie are incredibly the special effects are perfect to the point where it looks and feels real. I loved the way the other planets were designed not only is it incredible to look at but there feel like real places that could exist out there somewhere. Christopher Nolan always inspire fantastic performances from his actors (look no further than Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight) and Interstellar is no different as there is not a single bad performance in the movie but ultimately its Matthew McConaughey who steals the entire movie in an Oscar Worthy performance. The actress who play young Murph Mackenzie Foy is also fantastic here and stays on par with Jessica Chastian who plays Older Murph. Say whatever you like about Anne Hathaway but I really like her as an actress as she gives one of her best performances here. But unfortunately the great performances in the movie can not save Interstellar from its biggest issue, the characters. There's just so many of them and other than McConaughey you don't really care about any of them I couldn't even name the other members of the crew and characters like Michael Caine and Casey Affleck just don't seem important enough. Without spooling anything I will say that there was an incredible sequence in this movie that was spectacular to look at but ultimately merely felt like a means to advance the plot forward and came across as to easy. This is the longest of all the Christopher Nolan Movies and it shows because Interstellar is far to long I think they could have easily cut a good 30 minutes out it. Overall though I really to like Interstellar the performance, direction and set pieces are all fantastic even if it has some problems with its characterisation and script. 86%-A-",Interstellar

410,azanti0029,A film I had to digest which for all its grandeur left me feeling unconnected to the characters and their dilemmas.,6/10,22 November 2014,"It seemed everyone was looking forward to this movie and it reminded me of the hysteria leading up to Prometheus. Not wanting to inflict on myself that kind of disappointment again I choose to read or watch as little about the film as possible, having seen just an early trailer for it. I made sure I saw it on the biggest screen possible, on one of the few 70mm prints in Europe (Of which we were told there were only 4) It was too a packed out house, a good mix of all ages but a very serious looking audience none the less. I had a feeling we were in for an amazing ride so I took my wife to see it not wanting her to miss out on what might be the cinema event of the year. Like the Astronauts in the film I too wanted to know what was out there. The setting, as I am sure you know, is in earths near future, where most of the planet is ravaged by dust storms and the worlds food supply is nearing its end (Pretty similar to where we will be in a few years I am sure) most of the worlds population are farmers, keen to support its diminishing population, but time is running out and in secret the Government (America of course) is looking to the stars for answers and the discovery of a Black Hole may indeed prove our way out. Matthew McConaughey is the man who can, but he's gone back to farming and looking after his son and daughter. He's the best pilot, but if he goes he knows when he comes back his children will be older than he is, if they're still alive at all. So Interstella seems to offer us two dilemma's - the first being what is out there and can it offer us a future? The second being about personal sacrifice for the greater good and how do you know when it is worth it?I wanted more of the first and less of the second, but we seemed to get far too much of the second which was less engaging than the exploration of space and what there was of the first wasn't engaging enough. Every time the movie went back to earth it seemed to slow down, much like time in the movie. The first 45 minutes of the movie feels like the weakest. Some of the dialogue really is quite awful and seems so fake. I like McConaughey as an actor and the cast here are good, but the script really lets them down on some key moments especially early on. Interstella is a visual feast and if I was rating it on that alone it would get a straight 10 out of 10 but emotionally except for one key scene when messages from children long since aged are received by the characters it left me cold much of the time. The appearance of Matt Damon and his characters motivations were actually obvious to me and when they happened seemed more in place with Armageddon and an attempt to introduce drama for sake alone. For all its spectacle on the huge screen this was not a film that grabbed me and pulled me in and I so badly wanted it to. Yes some worlds are explored and its all water and ice, okay probably very scientific but exciting? I am not so sure and the supporting characters began to have the feel of Star Trek security detail and perhaps they should have been wearing red shirts as they all seem so expendable. Wes Bently really stood out for me here, I wanted to see more of him as he is so watchable and interesting on screen without really feeling the need to perform. The robots in the film were great and loved the way they functioned and were a nod to 2001. By the time we were into the last reel my wife had been to sleep three times, so this clearly wasn't her film. I was more engaged, but only just. People have pointed out the plot holes and yes there's many, but its really not those that bother me so much. I am not a Sci-Fi nerd, I am only interested in the world the film maker has created for me and if in its own context I believed that - I did believe it but I just didn't really like it that much - Ultimately maybe love does conquer all but for me, not here. I probably need to see the film again - I am just not sure that I want to.",Interstellar
411,craig-hopton,"Spectacular, moving, yet disappointing",7/10,11 April 2015,"An impressive spectacle. A moving SciFi drama. And yet a bit of a disappointment.The arc of the plot is clever. It follows a man who risks losing his family in order to follow an ambition for space exploration and to help save the human race, but who gets caught up in the lies and machinations of his NASA colleagues and friends. There is a nice ethical strand woven in about the instinct to save yourself versus saving others.The visuals are stunning. The spaceship visits three new planets, each of which is given its own dramatic character, not to mention the wormholes and black holes. Even the cornfields back home look fabulous.So what was disappointing?Firstly the acting. Matthew McConaughey made a dull hero and I could hardly understand his drawl. The supporting cast were so-so. The best performance is a cameo from an uncredited famous Hollywood actor (I won't spoil the surprise).Secondly the duration. The film is dragged out over nearly three hours but should have been less than two.Finally, the story just became too far- fetched for me. I'm OK with SciFi plots that stretch the boundaries of scientific realism, but saving humanity through the power of love spanning space and time was a step too far for me.I enjoyed Interstellar but it didn't live up to expectations.",Interstellar
412,lois-lane33,Not good enough.,4/10,3 January 2015,"This film made three major scientific errors: you can't have visible light from a black hole, you can't have planets around a black hole and you can't-according to current scientific theory- have a wormhole anywhere near a solar system. Thats a lot of scientific mistakes. I think many viewers compared this film to the classic film '2001 A Space Odyssey'. I don't think its comparable. The fantastic elements of 2001 were based on superior alien technology rather than never seen before because it can't exist natural phenomena. The film attempts to make up for its total lack of viable science by using some slick space ship designs, some unusual planets and some well known actors-quite a few of them in fact. It made me think of what a crook played by John Leguizamo said in the film 'Assault on District 13': 'its fascination politics""-as in this film is about mesmerizing its audience with slickness but not really saying anything that is classifiable as decent science fiction. That the world might not be able to feed itself is possible- that they might one day say that the Apollo flights never happened is also possible-but I think even a star studded cast couldn't save this sleight of hand show of a movie. Its been running forever in a cinema downtown nonetheless. To me its kind of a sad movie in that it really isn't very good but plenty of people think it is.",Interstellar
413,trans_mauro,"Tepid, at best",1/10,21 January 2015,"Oh my...Another ""Science Fiction"" film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life.Interstellar, is a boring slow, plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is.Cant't just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? Wouldn't it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole?If people want drama there are a huge number of other (much better) films. If I want to feel bad I will watch Schindler's list... If I want some good Science Fiction I will watch Aliens. Is it that hard for people to get it?This was supposed to be a science fiction adventure, for god's sake. Why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this over-bloated sentimentalism, this sacchariny mess? This is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead. They laud anything that is over complicated, with mindless twists, with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius.Interstellar is another extremely over rated film. It rivals Prometheus in stupidity!I'd rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it again...",Interstellar
414,chandean-69762,Interstellar 2014 Review,10/10,14 January 2021,"It's hard to put words together for a film like this. Mind-boggling? Introspective? Stunning? Stellar? (pun intended)
Interstellar really is one of those films that once the credits roll you just sit back in your seat and contemplate everything. It really has everything. Award winning acting from both main and supporting actors / actresses, an impactful and mind-bending story, beautiful awe-inspiring settings, a thrilling, phenomenal score, and some absolutely stunning visuals that leave you breathless.
I've seen this film twice in high school - once in physics and once in astrology. Both times I never really payed attention and only remember snippets of scenes. I really took for granted what I was watching, or maybe only watching it it 45 minute blocks also effected my viewing / attention towards the film. But now, three years after graduation I finally gave this film another shot. One of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen and definitely worth every second.
I would kill to see this in theatres.

415,LiamBlackburn,Waiting for Prometheus 2,7/10,11 November 2014,"I guess this is supposed to have a really humanistic theme to it. That's basically what it comes off as. I was slightly hoping that there were some aliens involved. At least ones that we could see and that may have been hostile. You know...maybe something more along the lines of Prometheus. Prometheus is my all time favourite sci-fi movie though so I guess that's expecting a lot. I kind of like the notion that the 5th dimensional beings who are trying to help the humans are actually humans from the future...sort of. It sort of works. It's just that...well...you can see the whole thing coming with like half the movie to go. Plus, the first half hour is all emotional humanistic table-setting. Yes, the table needs to be set. It just really lags on for too long. All in all this is a sort of successful film. Just sort of though.",Interstellar
416,FilmMuscle,Nolan's Interstellar Is Modern-Day Kubrick,10/10,10 November 2014,"We've been asking ourselves this same question for decades: what is humanity's and the earth's future? As much as some passé, clueless members of society continue denying the evidence of global warming and other detrimental environmental changes, science shows that Earth won't be able to sustain itself with the selfish manner in which humanity chooses to live. Then again, the fact that we act without further thought beyond our own self-interests is no revelation, but Interstellar herein shows the years ahead of heavy dust storms that riddle individuals with lung diseases and asthma (rising reports of asthma among people nowadays isn't news either)–reminiscent of the 1930's Dust Bowl, only to a considerably more dire extent. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) discovers that this planet will eventually die and that humanity will have to travel into the vast depths of the universe for a new home in order to survive. For humanity to continue, we need new discoveries—new pioneers. And so, Cooper is forced to leave his children behind in hopes of preserving their futures and thus launches into space as one of the best pilots left with a group of NASA explorers (including Anne Hathaway) to test the fascinating possibilities of space travel on a search for potential habitats where humans can continue their existence. In the meantime, his son and daughter (Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain in their later years, respectively) longingly wait for the chance that their father will perhaps one day return. This monumental and optimistic tale is about the utter capability of mankind and the necessity for human progress. Sadly, with the way modern generations behave and also considering the mentalities of even older ones, Interstellar could've easily been a cynical view of our prospects, but nonetheless, this human curiosity and aspiration that has gotten us this far into the future—the multitudinous stupendous technologies and the astonishing discoveries—can only inspire us to carry that attitude forward. ""We must think not as individuals, but as a species."" As we see Cooper's face inside a space helmet and a reflection of space's vastness on the glossy visor, we're immediately transported back to the ahead-of-its-time Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Walking out of the movie theater with a brain currently under repair, I couldn't help but smile at the fact that this generation now can proudly say they have their own 2001. On that note, it's also fair to say that you're intellectually helpless at that moment, and that Christopher Nolan's latest insane conception has left you entirely perplexed. Interstellar is so compacted with abstract, intricate scientific theories and thought-provoking philosophical themes that it's nearly impossible to wrap your mind around the film on a first viewing. Like 2010's Inception (only to an even greater degree), while the first time wildly impresses you with grandeur and ambition, it will probably require a few more viewings to truly appreciate the sheer depth and genius of the package. Unlike A Space Odyssey though, Interstellar is thankfully a lot friendlier to the mainstream crowd, and this is what I'll always admire about Nolan as a filmmaker. His films are never just plodding visual treats that primarily exist to present a broad idea after idea. Those complicated concepts are also supported by an incredibly gripping narrative with an actually intelligible, generously scripted plot. It's very well possible to sufficiently understand the overall story, the character's motivations, and the conclusion here; it's just the overly audacious and complex details behind and in between those plot points that truly open up the film to analysis years from now. The same way we scrutinize many Kubrick pictures even to this day, Interstellar might likely follow in that same vein with the probable release of numerous think pieces and fan videos that believe they finally have the full explanation to the movie's events and ideas. This surely being Nolan's most divisive film, among critics and audiences alike, certainly might support that notion—like with so many classics, Interstellar could just be ahead of its time, only to be enriched in the eyes of many people years later. Beyond a narrative of incredible scope and ambitious structure, Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography immerses us that much more with real footage of the sky above and the camera's movement that perfectly responds to the perilous, tremulous events that follow one another on this incessantly tense journey. We see wide beautiful shots of glaciers and the menacing, yet wholly alluring, sight of that constantly imposing, threatening nature of space (from the black holes to the gargantuan planets). Hans Zimmer's epically harmonic score (tamer/more minimalistic than his previous work with Nolan, yet more emotionally resonant) excellently establishes that grand wonder of space exploration but also the frightening thought of the sheer danger that makes the universe's immensity. The reverberant sound effects and psychedelic visuals that accompany this grandiose adventure make for an unbelievable cinematic memory that will unlikely be replicated for decades to come. On the other hand, the film does face frustrating sound mixing issues—many moments feature loud music or sound effects that lengthily drown out dialogue. Especially given McConaughey's nearly-whispering diction, this unfortunate technical element clearly doesn't alleviate moviegoers' confusion with the story in the first place.

417,lucasversantvoort,Close but no cigar,7/10,6 May 2015,"Interstellar is a film that transcends the label 'film' and instead becomes an 'experience'. Director Nolan embarks on an interstellar journey seeking to touch upon various universal themes. This all coalesces into a film that undoubtedly has its fair share of problems, but the overall experience more than makes up for it.Interstellar presents its own spin on a dystopian future. Food production is grinding to a halt due to a never-ending series of dust storms. Widow and former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer whose 10-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) believes her room is haunted. Cooper gives her the 'there's no such thing as ghosts' treatment, but they soon discover some kind of 'intelligence' is leaving coded messages in the form of binary coordinates. Cooper intends to go alone, but Murph sneaks onboard Cooper's truck. They stumble upon a secret NASA base led by professor Brand (Michael Caine). Brand explains that a recently discovered wormhole might be the key to humanity's salvation. Due to the sorry state of the earth, the next generation might very well be the last and new habitable planets must be discovered. Cooper reluctantly—and to Murph's devastation—joins the crew, consisting of Brand's daughter, biologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway), physicist Romilly, geographer Doyle and two robots who bear more than a passing resemblance to 2001's monolith. One of the major things that left me satisfied was Nolan's mostly competent handling of the emotional content, particularly the relationship between Cooper and Murph. Nolan has always been more interested in 'ideas' and the emotional accessibility of his depictions of human emotions and relationships have suffered for it. Case in point: Inception. I never really 'felt' the relationship between Cobb and Mal. Yes, it was thematically tied to the concepts of dreams, but I never cared for it. Particularly their last scene features some really awkward writing. In Interstellar however, Nolan and his brother have stepped up their game and ensured Cooper and Murph's relationship was well-handled. This is mostly due to McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy. The scene where Cooper talks to her before leaving and how his leaving is sonically crosscut with the countdown prior to the ship taking off, was the first time the film engaged me on an emotional level and that's something you don't get with every Nolan film. (Spoilers) Another compelling moment is when things spiral out of control on a planet featuring tidal waves the size of buildings. They narrowly escape and realize the time they spent there equals 23 years on Earth. Cooper is then confronted with 23 years' worth of video recordings made by his family. It's a highly impactful moment. These scenes are some of the best parts of the film, because Nolan perfectly applies the science behind it (in this case, relativity) to enhance the human drama and the emotional content.If the film has a major weakness, it's the expository dialogue. A sci-fi film of this scale naturally can't avoid exposition, but it occasionally undercuts the emotional impact of the film. The scene with the recordings I just mentioned is followed up by a scene featuring a rather uncomfortable monologue on the concept of 'love' which feels awkward, especially after the emotional directness of the previous scene. Other parts of the film also suffer from this tendency to use expository dialogue surrounding emotional moments. This is only exacerbated by some of the dialogue sounding really unnatural. There's a plot twist where Cooper and the rest find out they've been lied to somewhat, to which Amelia responds, ""but the lie, the monstrous lie."" If that sounds like something that an actual human being would say, then you're wrong. The film doesn't collapse under the weight of all the exposition though and it mostly succeeds in making the film more accessible (though I can't possibly comment on the scientific accuracy). It's just that you can feel that Nolan is more a director of 'ideas' and there are just as many times when he fails in molding it all into a thrilling whole as there are times when he succeeds (the wave scene and its aftermath).Also noteworthy is Nolan's response to reviews decrying the score's overwhelming nature and how it tends to drown out dialogue. He responded by saying he doesn't ""agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions—I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal—picture and sound."" What I find hilarious is that while denouncing dialogue as the sole means for conveying ideas and emotions, he nevertheless fills Interstellar to the brim with 'deliberately meaningful' and expository dialogue, sometimes to the point of losing the audience's emotional investment.I've read discussions on whether it's the next 2001. Only time will tell, but I think the main thing holding Interstellar back in this regard is something that characterizes most of Nolan's epics: the tendency to please everyone, to combine the epic scale of a Hollywood blockbuster with 'intelligent' filmmaking. Whereas 2001 has always been an undefinable film, Interstellar is highly conventional. Take the action sequences for instance. 2001's 'action scenes' were defined by a deliberately slow pace that emphasized how humans are like fish out of water in space whereas Interstellar's tend to feel more 'blockbuster-y'; they're there so the film doesn't devolve into a dissertation on universal themes.All in all, there's a lot to appreciate about Interstellar. The acting is formidable, the emotional scenes are mostly well-handled (somewhat of a first for Nolan), the action scenes (particularly the wave scene) are intense and the science on display is intriguing without it hurting the film's appeal. The next 2001 it's not, but it's definitely one hell of an experience, warts and all.",Interstellar
418,tinovalkki,Great but not perfect,9/10,22 November 2014,"Last year's Gravity picked many Oscar's and I would love to happen the same for Interstellar this year, though I think it have to settle for few technical Oscar's only. Matthew McConaughey is very good at the leading role, but because he won the Oscar last year for the leading role of Dallas Buyers Club, he probably won't get it for the second time subsequent. I could easily give this year's best movie Oscar to Interstellar, but the actor's guild may think that Interstellar borrow's too much of it's themes from Stanley Kubrick's A Space Odyssey 2001. Interstellar is very scientifically accurate movie as we know about space travel, worm holes and black holes today. This makes it interesting and clever depiction our changes to travel vast spaces. Hans Zimmers music is beautiful and powerful and it deepens movie themes beautifully. I probably would give at least a Oscar nomination because for that, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. After all Interstellar is one of the best and most visually stunning movie this year so far which makes it one of the musts to watch it in movie theater. It is well worth of a movie ticket. As it's best Interstellar is beautiful and enormous movie spectacle which sustain many times to watch. One of the best movie this year anyway.

420,chi_town_fed,Excellent film. Casting and writing could have been better in some areas.,8/10,31 October 2019,"Strong film! The premise and the conceptual solution were amazing. I did not know what to expect from credit to credit making this film anything but predictable. The science around gravity and time was cool.The few things I did not care for (which are subjective) is they cast Anne Hathaway as a lead scientist, which I could not buy into. The role did not fit her personality IMHO. I did, however, like Jessica Chastain as ""Murph."" I think she was a good pick for the role and played it well. She seemed more authentic as a scientist than Hathaway. I have nothing against Anne Hathaway. I like her. I just feel the role she played would have been a better fit for someone else. Again, this is very subjective, and she did a decent job, not epic.I also did not care for Matt Damon's dialogue (I love almost all of his movies). The writing for his role turned me off. After the revival scene (when he initially wakes up) the rest seemed wooden and inauthentic. I think they should have kept the dialogue short when they were walking on the ice or during the fight versus continuous dialogue. Even after the fight he was still talking about human reaction to blah blah blah. He should have stood silently, possibly showing facial emotions such as guilt or sadness, then walked away. Instead he kept yammering: ""What you are feeling is this human emotion and that human emotion because of this and that."" I just wanted him to shut up and get on with it. His dialogue completely distracted from the scene, versus adding to it. I blame the writers for this. However, the action involving his character was cool and dramatic.Also, I did not care for the way Matthew McConaughey sent the message(s) in the end. How he arrived there to send the message was utterly ridiculous. It seemed like something out of a Peter Pan book for four year olds. Even if you accept the nonsensical way he arrived at the place to send the message, why did he shrink to a size that was shorter than the height of a book??? That made it even more ridiculous. I get the gravity and time parts, I have yet to understand why he shrank in size like Ant Man. That was just plain stupid. I won't even touch the watch thing. That was stupid too.For such a great movie, they should have come up with a more plausible explanation and message delivery system.Beyond these short comings (which are few and short lived), this movie was spectacular!!! The music score was great as it drew me into the moment. The concept and the plot were gripping. These aspects help to offset the shortcomings in this film.This is a must-see movie!!!",Interstellar
421,yashrajs536,A good movie but not to the Nolan's level,7/10,2 February 2015,I first of all start by saying that I am a Nolan fan because of his excellent work on his films I mean the man who took the Batman movies to an another level I like his work on The dark knight trilogy and inception.When I watched interstellar I hadn't felt that excitement I always feel in Nolan's films in this film many technical words are used and the story is also a bit different from its trailer.The story looked a bit confusing and also it looked it has lacked at some points the acting was good but I felt that the development of the characters are not properly done.And I was also confused when the film came into its climax I never understood this movie I suggest the people who have knowledge of astronomy and about space can go and watch this film it is not suitable for normal people.But I liked Nolan's work.His direction superb as always I am no saying that I am totally disappointed but due to the confusion I felt while watching this movie I felt a bit bored but how much part i understood it was good I am saying the movie is good not excellent as per the Nolan's level.I will give it an 7/10 wish I could give 10/10 if I had understood the movie.,Interstellar

I should have known better that Christopher Nolan can deliver! I am in tears and I want to rate it already 10/10 but I will wait until the end, just for the formality 2h 29minutes - Inception (2010) was only a warm up for your brain to understand this film What a ride... Damn... I don't know what to write... This film is so much. Hahah now I am laughing at what I have written @ 30 minutes... If you will watch it, you will understand why it makes me giggle.

423,postsenthil,A MUST WATCH (preferably in IMAX) !!,8/10,27 October 2019,"Christopher Nolan holds a special place among Hollywood's top billed directors for his unique credo of creating mammoth blockbusters which venture beyond being a slam-bang visual spectacle to engage the viewers' grey matter. After The Dark Knight Rises, the triumphant capping to a glorious Gotham trilogy and nested, nebulous dreamscapes of Inception, with Interstellar, Nolan has set his sight quite literally beyond the visible horizon. As in the case of excellent Inception, Nolan is again fiddling with one of his pet themes of asymmetric time lines across one or more planes. The vastly differing speeds of passage of times between earth and in space, especially close to black holes.
In the not so distant future, the survival of human beings on earth is at peril. Global warming and ecological degradation induced blights have killed most of our food crops and corn is the sole surviving food crop. The human race is on the brink of a near certain extinction through starvation and diseases induced frequent dust storms. The human race is pushed back to pre-industrial agrarian age to sustain life on the planet where schools train students to become food-growers of the future.Cooper (Mathew McConaughey), a widower, former NASA pilot turned forced farmer, lives in rural America with his son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law. Murph is an intelligent and curious kid who shares a deep bond with her father. Strange events involving the bookshelf of their home set Cooper and Murph in a journey which leads them to a secret installation which happens to be a near defunct NASA headed by Professor Brand (Michale Caine) and his team including the Professor's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway).Professor Brand states that they are planning to send a team of astronauts on an inter-galactic mission to find new planets suitable for human inhabitation. To this end, the mission would make use of a large wormhole that had appeared mysteriously near Saturn some years ago. Brand urges Cooper to be the pilot of this mission as the other members have no flying experience outside a simulator. Cooper accepts the offer much to the chagrin of Murph who believes that this is dangerous and could well be an one-way journey. Nevertheless, Cooper sets out on this daredevil mission after making a solemn promise to Murph to return from the mission, no matter what the circumstances.It is also revealed that NASA under Professor Brand has been working on utilizing the mysterious wormhole for several years to find new inhabitable planets in far away galaxies to replace the earth which is withering in a wasting dust bowl. They have already sent several manned probes - called Lazarus missions - through the said wormhole and three of them such probes have been transmitting some basic signals indicating potential destinations which could hold promise for humanity. Brand wants Cooper to lead a mission through the wormhole to explore these three planets for possibilities of human sustenance. Meanwhile, Brand is also working on earth in solving an equation which could help escape earth's gravity and enable a larger mission to transport humans from earth to a planet to be located by Cooper and his team. If the transport of humans at such a large scale to the new planet, which is Plan A, fails to succeed, Brand has devised a Plan B which involves creating a new settlement on the new planet from a collection of fertilized embryos being transported along with Cooper and his team.Cooper's team includes Amelia Brand, physicist Romilly, geographer Doyle, and two multi-purpose artificially intelligent robots- CASE and TARS. Their long mission involves an initial docking with a rotating space station Endurance which would, in turn, carry them on a two year long trip to Saturn in hypersleep mode. Thereafter, they traverse through the wormhole to reach a distant galaxy where they find that the three planets to be explored by them - Miller, Mann & Edmunds (named after the pilots who had flown on the initial Lazarus missions and reached those planets) - are orbiting around a super massive black hole called Gargantua.The intense gravity of the black hole distorts space time in such a way that one hour in a planet orbiting near the black hole could be the equivalent of seven years in the earth time. This poses an additional constraint of time on Cooper's team over and above the limitation of fuel to explore these planets and return to earth before the human race embraces a painful extinction through starvation. While Cooper and team are busy on their mission which skews their time line, several decades pass on earth, where we find that the now grown up Murph (Jessica Chastain), a brilliant astrophysicist, is assisting Professor Brand in solving the equation while Tom (Casey Affleck) is struggling to sustain the farm and save his family.What happens to Cooper and his team as they set out to explore these three planets ? Could they explore all the three planets ? Could they identify a planet hospitable to human sustenance ? Did Professor Brand solve the equation that could help him operationalise Plan A ? Could Cooper keep his promise to Murph ? Could Cooper's team find the planet in time to save the human race from extinction ? How did the worm hole near Saturn come about in the first place ? Who had put it there ? An technologically advanced race of aliens ? Or super-evolved humans ? Why would such an advanced race want to help us in the first place ? The movie answers most of these questions through a narrative spanning across galaxies while raising several others as we walk out of the movie hall. Remember, the scene in Inception where a whole city folds in half over itself.. Suffice to say that the Nolans have written Interstellar in manner quite similar to Inception's city such that the entire movie folds over itself as it proceeds to its conclusion.This is a movie which engages, nay, demands the viewer's undivided attention to understand the proceedings on screen. In fact, it would help a great deal if we go prepared with some basic understanding about stuff like black holes, worm holes and time travel (Click here for a quick primer from Stephen Hawkings himself).The movie checks several key elements which we have come to identify as a Nolan template - be it dealing in wildly ambitious themes dealing with cerebral &/or psychological conflicts, exceptional set pieces, movies which kindle several questions which linger on long after viewing and which requires repeat viewings & further reading for better understanding and above all movies which are superlatively entertaining. While it is true that the movie deals with dense and theoretical concepts in physics, it is to the credit of Nolan that he renders most of these accessible within a narrative which results in a momentous movie that stretches the horizons of a Hollywood blockbuster. Yet, at its very core, this is a very human drama involving the emotional bond between a daughter and her doting father which places love as a force which transcends all dimensions -hitherto known and unknown. While a drama like this can be set in any period or geography, Nolan, true to his penchant, has chosen to stage this on an interstellar scale, in a very literal sense.While not a very challenging role in the league of Dallas Buyers Club, Academy Award winner McConaughey sparkles in the role of Cooper and is effective especially in his scenes as a vulnerable and emotionally conflicted father. But, it is Mackenzie Foy who plays the young Murph whose performance which tops the charts among a cast which includes such renowned performers as regular Nolan collaborator Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway among others. While Hans Zimmer's score puts the galactic proceedings on an overdrive with a thumping score, Hoyt Van Hoytema, who has handled the camera in the absence of Nolan regular Wally Pfister, captures the action in space in visuals which are simply overwhelming.Interstellar does not trump the towering 2001 - A Space Odyssey, which remains the definitive touchstone for a space movie. Yet, Nolan's movie, despite its calculated cinematic liberties, succeeds in bridging the narrative of a Hollywood blockbuster to cutting edge concepts in space science (thanks to his collaboration with renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne), which are accessible to the commons. And, while it may, on the surface, appear to be a sensational sci-fi flick set in space packed with resplendent visuals and set-pieces, Nolan has suffused its core with the power of love and bonding in what could well be his most heartfelt movie till date.",Interstellar
424,jaimemedina-36288,A sci-fi classic,10/10,7 June 2021,"There's so much going on in this movie. There are so many great performances; there's a beautiful moral, and a lesson or two we can all take to heart. Please forgive the pun if I observe that this is a multi dimensional achievement.I'll not analyze the physics as Thorne has done that sufficiently. And to a person EVERYONE in the cast turns in a great performance.There are so many ways I love this movie: as a movie buff, as a lover of science, as a thinker and a dreamer, as someone concerned about our world, and as a father...I just don't know what more I could ask from a movie. The only thing that comes to mind... a sequel.

425,Camoo,Decent sci-fi for the masses,6/10,7 November 2014,"Interstellar contains some of the most magnificent imagery you will see in any film this year; it is gorgeous to look at, technically spectacular, and creatively executed. But there are problems at some of the most basic levels. What the movie lacks is a believable script and striking, three dimensional characters to propel us onto this journey. And unlike two obvious reference points - Contact and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it doesn't have the scientific authority (i.e. a Carl Sagan or an Arthur C. Clarke) to bring its high minded concept to life in a believable fashion. Not that a film needs to be scientifically sound to be enjoyable, but Interstellar tries so hard to be profound and amazing that it lags in other crucial areas. Dialogue, pacing, and character development should have been locked in place before they conceived of taking an audience up into space with these people. What makes it all the more frustrating is that so many of the pieces seem to be in place, including a buffet of great actors who pop up with such frequency that we lose count - John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, Topher Grace, Michael Caine etc etc all make respective appearances before disappearing entirely from our memories. Best among the bunch is Matthew McConaughey, who does his damned best to wring a performance out of his role as good ol' farmer/physicist Coop, but without the emotional tendrils, he's left drifting. Coop is decidedly McConoughey's least interesting or dynamic role since 2008's Surfer Dude. There are positives. The film has some moments of real invention - particularly when the crew start making their way through worm holes and black holes. These are the most interesting and beautiful visualizations of these phenomena I have ever seen, and the sheer detail of the visual effects during these sequences is astonishing, and Nolan's choice of slowing down the action long enough for us to reflect on its beauty is in the spirit of 2001's most evocative scenery. The film's score by Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, a hymnal ode to mankind which gives the impression that the entire soundtrack has been filtered through a cathedral. Like I said, a film like this will predictably shoot up the IMDb's top 200. It's designed for mass appeal, with just enough profundity to appeal to the critics. It will be nominated for lots and lots of stuff. And it should. But personally I want a film that has a bit more integrity at the script level.",Interstellar
426,yongkang-27205,Simply WOW,8/10,5 November 2020,"I do not know how to put it into words. This film really was amazing. Other than the fact that there is a meme in there, the whole storyline was simply mind blowing. I liked how every bit of detail was thoughtfully added which helped to become key details in the film.Besides, the whole cast only made the whole film better. When they returned to the ship from the first planet, the emotional torment they went through really stuck to me. Also, the bits of humour with the robot that they interwoven throughout the movie was pretty good too.Lastly, I will say that it's spot in the Imdb is definitely well deserved and was well worth my 3 hours.",Interstellar
427,deschreiber,painful and stupid,3/10,21 November 2014,"First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door.",Interstellar
428,stonedraim,"In three words: WONDERFUL, AMAZING AND FANTASTIC!",9/10,12 March 2016,"*** May contain strong spoilers ***I'll start off with a little personal touch: maybe one of the best movies I have ever seen! I write this review over 4 months after have seen the film, and still I have the emotion of a masterpiece within myself.As a firm believer of ""there is more to know about the universe"" I really got hooked from the start with this creation.Matthew takes this one out of the ball park. The character of a father that comes back into the whole universe of space (pun intended) is somewhat of a vast task, and still he gets it all the way.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : very high quality and solid work all around. (Sound: good. Screen and picture: great. Editing: very good.) Won an Oscar for the production; says it all. - The actors : Well... 8.6 on IMDb says a lot. Great acting, splendid director. - The story : in its time (pun intended). Science is making breakthroughs and the human is getting more and more information about how the universe exists and got for the astronauts to explore. In a sense there is a little feeling of video games in the story; get into the worm hole... explore three planets... find out what is going on... - Entertainment : Have heard both sides... ""this movie is a waste of time and reaaaally should be thrown into the garbage can"" to ""What an extraordinary and amazing piece of art!!"". Personally; nearly 10 out of 10. - Age : Couple of dramatic scenes that may be to much for the youth. Maybe too philosophic for the young ones, so I would recommend from 15 and up.Christopher Nolan; thank You for another one! Keep up the fantastic and wonderful work! This creation is definitely an interstellar... another pun ;)Instead of writing a bunch of what this picture is all about and the story, I'll just make the statement that; You have to see this... and....well....

429,i_odin,Gold standard for science fiction,9/10,5 January 2019,"The strong performances, the gripping story and the heart wrenching reality of inter-steller space makes it one of the best Science Fiction ever.
The near correct depiction of wormholes and blackholes (thanks to Kip Thorne) makes me wonder what it took to make the Studios agree to it. But it definitely adds to the beauty of the world created by Nolan brothers along with the masterfully crafted and breathtaking special effects and Zimmer's ear-soothing music.
Each time I watch this movie, it fills me with awe. And to be honest also kind of spooks me about the vast emptyness surrounding our planet Earth.

There is nothing else that comes close to what this movie achieves. The visual a amazing, the acting is amazing and the story is amazing. Every twist was just perfect and really shocked me, every emotional scene hit hard and made me care for the characters. My one complaint is that I haven't watched it twice. I need to as I don't believe I fully understood the movie but would after a second watch, then I could give it a higher score. For that reason, 8/10 watch it, then watch it again.

Her father, who she knew had like a day of notice about the entire mission.I can buy her getting upset when Dr Brand said that, and maybe even her freaked out message to the younger Dr Brand, but she keeps the anger and unless it on her brother.That's the most glaring personal thing. From technical pov's, they need a Saturn-V class rocket to launch from earth, yet they can land and DEPART a planet with such a gravity well that time is 7 years per relative hour with a lander craft about the size of a Cesna.

The cast is first rate and therefore the touching moments and action are done with a first class touch. The only minus for me and it might be my limited understanding in science is there where parts I just didn't get.
But overall a very good blockbuster.

433,charles000,Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film . . .,10/10,7 June 2018,"Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film, and that's saying a lot since I very rarely score any film of any genre with a 10 or even a 9.This production is so radically different, even if you don't happen to be a sci-fi fan or one who ponders the greater questions of existence on this world and in the universe, this production will open up this realm of thought via a journey that is spectacular.The closest conceivable comparison that might be possible would be Stanley Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey, but that's only a very rough analogy at best.Every aspect of this production was crafted about as perfectly as could be given the context of the story, and what it's trying to convey. Are there technical or scientific flaws as such as portrayed? Yes, of course, much of this is wrapped around theoretical concepts which are still very much a work in progress.But that such a complex and compelling concept could be woven into a story with such heart, mapped into the very essence of what it is to be human . . . this is a film very much worth the time spent to watch it.My suggestion would be that you may likely watch it several times, as various layers and dimensions become evermore present in ways that may not have been initially apparent the first time going in.A special thumbs up to Anne Hathaway, this may have been her best role ever (in my admittedly biased opinion), but everyone in this film shines.The direction, cinema photography, production quality . . . absolutely top notch, don't think this could have been done much better.As I said earlier, even if this is not your typical cup of tea, take a sip with this one. I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.My score 10+",Interstellar
434,80sHorror,ABSOLUTE Over-hyped TOSH,1/10,21 February 2015,"AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor. The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth - a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman) opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................ very quickly out of the cinema. Ps I love Matthew McConaughey in true detective and I can't believe I was looking at the same actor

437,Lomedin,Not such a big deal,6/10,18 January 2016,"We have to start by acknowledging that C. Nolan has been, for a while, Hollywood's golden boy and, as such, people will undoubtedly deify him; such is the dynamic of this strange and absurd system we live in. Thus, we can understand all the hype this movie receives, regardless of its authenticity.As, for me, from the beginning, after the ""ghost"" is mentioned, I saw clearly how that was going to develop; such obviousness scores quite a few negative points for the Nolan brothers' imagination, creativity and originality. Something disappointing, taking in consideration some of the previous works. There's definitely more predictability in this movie than in previous ones, or so was my impression. Particularly, I see a bit too many similarities in ideas, cinematography and even music, to 2001. Apart from that, all that sentimentalism could have been turn down a notch, and clearly the whole ""love"" concept. Still, there's much less of that than what you can find is the vast majority of productions nowadays (something that tells us how low the level of quality of movies and series is). Interesting how Matthew McConaughey was also involved in Contact, a movie that also touches one or two points present in Interstellar. Fortunately, the level of sentimentalism doesn't reach those of Contact and, even better, this movie doesn't dwell in god and such nonsense (something which killed Gravity for me).Although the special effects are no doubt very good, all the talk about IMAX and so on made me expect something much more impressive in that department.The story itself was, for me, a bit weak, and some points seemed to be connected with each others just ""because"", or by very fragile threads. For all the praise I've heard about Interstellar ""science"", I've seen a good few unexplained ""scientific"" events in the movie which just seem to be taken for granted, and I can't see the science behind them anywhere.The fact that this is a story -once again- about how to make humanity survive didn't help my opinion, since there's no real intelligent reason, apart from selfishness and survival instincts, to see our species perpetuated along with its destructive behaviour towards all other lifeforms and itself. That makes me connect to the ""fake moon landing"" scene, and how all these recent NASA movies might be part of some sort of propaganda machine to, once more, makes us look up to the stars instead of caring more for our planet and trying to stop and reverse all the misery we have been, for centuries, bringing upon it and all its inhabitants.Alas, not a bad movie to watch, but certainly not the shining jewel they want us to believe this is. As I said at the beginning, that's how the system (and thus, the masses), work.",Interstellar
438,PaxtonMalloy,Nolan didn't do it again,6/10,8 November 2014,"Sadly, Interstellar did not deliver as the next Nolan masterpiece. I have no intention to see that movie ever again. It is really a strange movie in many ways but lets go into detail.Actors Matthew McConaughey was always more of an mediocre actor. At some point that changed and he reached no heights in Wolf of Wallstreet, True Detective and Dallas Buyers Club. This movie is no exception, he is totally believable throughout the movie. But thats it. Ann Hathaway doesn't really fit in here, not one of her finest hours. Same goes for the rest of the spaceship crew. Casey Affleck or Topher Grace have no time to shine since they are on Screen for just a few minutes. Even the legendary Michael Caine is basically Alfred again with a bad twist.Story Thats were everything went wrong. The exposition is just terrible. We see that there is an issue with sand killing the corn. Then Matthew accidentally finds the hiding spot of the NASA. And they are like ""hey good you here. we already know you from back in the day. We are starting a mission to save the world without you but since you here and you are the best man for the job why don't you do it and leave your family."" And of course without hesitation Matthew does it. Thats just poor storytelling. If they know him, why don't they contact him. And it is a movie a visual medium. If the earth is about to die we need to see it, it is not enough to say it. During the movie we jump through time sometimes not knowing where we are and because of countless boring dialogs we loose focus of the conflict between him and the daughter he left.Dialog Dialog needs to have conflict. We don't have that here. All the crew does is talking and explaining everything to each other which is the worst form of dialog there is.Sound and Cinematography This is something Nolan can do in his sleep. Nothing to complain here. Nice pictures and an epic score, all fine by me.Conclusion The Score and Matthew can not rescue the bad storytelling and the even worse dialog. The end with the 4 dimensional bookshelf world is the point where it jumps the shark eventually. But Nolan should not worry, the hype and the epic pictures will make this movie a box office success. Even though in a few years no one will really remember why. Nolan is still an outstanding director. You simply can not deliver every time.",Interstellar
439,MattBirk,Top 10 Movie of 2014....But Not The Best,8/10,9 November 2014,"I cannot remember the last time I've been this split about a movie, the way I am with 'Interstellar'. The movie features a general plot that I absolutely love, Earth is dying and Earth's remaining survivors must send people in search for a new planet to save mankind. I've always been fascinated by space and I love how Nolan explores the unknown, such as far off galaxies, wormholes, blackholes, and gravity. The brilliance is that he is basically free to do whatever he wants with them since hardly anything is known about such anomalies. Time was at the center of the movie, it was the driving force for the main character and it was intriguing to see how time manipulated people's motives, its a force you cannot fight and win against. But on the other end of the spectrum, with a movie like this, you open up a door to a plethora of questions, which happens to be the case. There are moments where the movie just forces you to assume something with very little explanation (especially characters motives for doing certain acts). The movie also beats you over the head with constant talk about gravity and relativity, as if the entire audience had a PhD in physics. That was a huge drawback for the film, it relied so heavily on those concepts that it was hard to follow or understand as they went from one idea to the next with little explanation. You know when you have a real life physicist on the set explaining such topics to you, that the audience might be left behind scratching their heads. As for the acting department, the movie was surprisingly tame, outside of Matthew Mcconaughey, no one stood out, they just did their jobs and that was the end of it. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine were all fine, but certainly nothing to brag about. As for the ending, I still have mixed feelings about it, I really wanted a huge 'No way!' curveball thrown at me, but instead we got an overly explained ending that we knew would tie into the beginning of the film. But it was sort of bittersweet in a sense and I kind of enjoy that type of thing. But again, not enough can be said about the general ideas Nolan wanted to put on screen, they were ambitious and very intriguing to think about post film. I'm glad someone took a chance on such complicated and sought after ideas, even if they came up short (we surely will not be seeing something of this caliber in a very long time). Best movie of 2014?........sadly no. That title belongs to 'Gone Girl' or 'Snowpiercer'Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com",Interstellar
440,jindann,Another pseudo science movie by nolan.,5/10,23 May 2021,"Slow paced in the beginning, the story is fairly boring and unconvincing. While the theory may seem intriguing, the reality is no one can survive entering a black hole let alone getting out, one would be long dead far away from it before even entering. Most of nolans movies were actually saved by good cgi, casts and actions rather than the story.

So I came with high standards.The Martian (2015) was actually mostly based on real science and it was a well written and produced film. I gave it a 9/10; lost a star for some scientific inaccuracies.This garbage on the other hand was the most absurd piece of writing I have ever seen in my life. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan must have had a crazy cocktail of dr*** in their system for them to come up with this foolishness. They took a couple theories and then let their imagination rampant with them to create obscene fiction.Ending explained:
So some guy is inside a black hole's point of no return and he finds himself inside a 5-Dimensional space built by HUMANS from the future and from there that guy somehow communicates to Earth in morse code to the FUTURE (his daughter is a grown woman). But this is not the first time he has done all of this traveling and ""communication"" because he has already done this whole trip and ""communication"" in the PAST (his daughter is a teenager). Then the guy is saved by the future humans and take him to their floating ship/home and somehow his daughter is now an elderly woman in that floating ship and she has a dozen family members. What? And then the guy leaves that comfortable floating ship and goes to the planet he was originally searching for that was basically like Earth. Credit: thanks to the site LOOPER for the explanation of the absurd ending.Theory of relativity? Gravitational time dilation? Wormholes? Time traveling to the future and the past? No wonder nobody cares about cosmologists or astrophysicists or takes them seriously.Now the Nolans took astrophysics and then just let their insanity run unstoppably. Escaping a black hole's point of no return without a scratch? Communicating from a black hole's point of no return to Earth to the future AND the past? 5-Dimensional space inside a black hole? The whole plot is about helping humanity find and get to a ""second earth"", but instead once they escape they decide to live in a floating ship? Why did the daughter end up on a floating ship and not on the ""second earth?"" Why is humanity not living in the second earth???The plot might have sounded cool and interesting ON PAPER when the Nolans pitched it to the producers and it may have been a cool sci-fi novel to read, but as a movie it was just obscenely crazy. This movie was only a success because Matt Damon and Matthew McConaughey are in it and because the love aspect of the film was strong.The one thing I will admit was a strength of this film was the LOVE between the father and the daughter being able to transcend time and space - that was absolutely beautiful and touched me. That was the only redeeming quality of this movie's plot. I do not understand why he did not have that connection with his son though. Regardless, that demonstration of love was beautiful and powerful and surely touched all viewers.Conclusion: most preposterous and nonsensical sci-fi movie movie I have ever seen. However, I did like the father-daughter love connection that transcended time and space.3/10",Interstellar
442,Doublej20005,A Stunning Cinematic Achievement,10/10,26 December 2020,"Christopher Nolan is probably my favourite director of all time with FIVE 5-star films from him that I've seen. This was the last major Nolan film I had yet to see, and I absolutely loved it. The visuals in this film are just fantastic. Even if I watched this on mute I'd still get more out of it than most films. The score is just absolutely phenomenal too - people make fun of Hans Zimmer's scores a lot, but they really work at building tension in my opinion, and bar Inception this might be his best work. The direction is fantastic and the sheer scale of the film just blew me away. At risk of sounding cliche, this felt very 2001: A Space Odyssey, except with a legitimately engaging story (and I love 2001 so that's a huge compliment). The relationship between Cooper and Murph is well explored. The main issue that people have with Tenet is that The Protagonist doesn't have much of an emotional connection with anyone, meaning the personal stakes are kind of low. I didn't mind this myself, but this film just showed that Nolan can do personal stakes and do them really well. Part of this is Matthew McConaughey's outstanding performance, but mostly it's just how their relationship is set up during the opening and how well it is closed off. The ending just blew me away, and every direction that the story took really worked for me. My only nitpick is that some of the exposition felt a tad clunky towards the beginning, but exposition is important in a film this high-concept, so I can forgive that. And, for an almost 3 hour film, I didn't feel the length for a second. Overall, this is an inspiring, beautiful and an utterly fantastic film, and one of Nolan's best.",Interstellar
443,stefankrs,Amazing,10/10,23 September 2021,"This movie is beautiful, a great work in the sci-fi genre. The movie is beautiful, great visuals, the effects are amazing, the set pieces are beautiful, the soundtrack fits perfectly well. This movie is just an amazing sci-fi work, very interesting story, and pretty emotional. This is truly one of the greatest movies of the 2010's.

444,vistheindian,Interstellar – Relatively perfect,8/10,6 November 2014,"Quickie Review:Humanity faces extinction as the world can no longer produce the food to sustain themselves. This leads to the choice of either exploring far away worlds in search of a new home, or accepting the end, left to fade into the dust. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his team embark upon a journey into deep space to find such a new home, and save the human race along with his daughter. Director Christopher Nolan is well known for his intricate and often complex stories, Interstellar is no exception. Visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is impactful, and the cast is strong with McConaughey being the excellent emotional anchor. Unfortunately, when the intangible is explored the strangeness of the ideas displayed can be distracting and pull you out of the moment. Still this is a must see movie for successfully melding the ambitious take on the sci-fi genre with the human drama.Full Review:Story-telling master Christopher Nolan, the recent McConaughaissance, combined with sci-fi which sane movie lover would say no to that?! I had to see it on the opening night and I expected to be blown away. Thankfully as a whole Interstellar did deliver on the high expectations, but I have to admit there is one problem with this movie that bothers me enough to not give it the perfect score.Everyone in the cast did a great job but the standout by far is McConaughey. He plays his character Cooper with incredible depth and that helped a lot to make us care about what he's going through for his daughter. Add all the visuals in the universe, but it won't make a difference if the lead was not strong. So safe to say the McConaughaissance is still going strong. The father-daughter relationship is the emotional core, and they share some scenes together that hit you right in the soft spot of your heart. As for two of your five senses (six if you see ghosts) sound and sight, they are both in for a delicious treat. Visually this movie is gorgeous, multiple times my jaw dropped in awe. It is all the more impressive that for the first time ever the black holes and worm holes have actual mathematical and physics basis for how they have been depicted. Facts can be stranger than fiction, strangely beautiful, and there are countless moments of that in Interstellar. The sounds and music only help amplify the effect of the visuals. More than once I was clenching my fist and biting my fingers because of the intensity building up with Hans Zimmer's score. I think this may be Zimmer's most unique soundtrack since Inception.My problems with the movie has to do with the story. Before I explain further I have to be clear about this, I actually really like the story. Nolan is meticulous with Interstellar, the amount of attention given to the effect of scientific theories on the structure of the story is impressive. This reminds me to caution you about the scientific expositions given in the movie. All you need to know is how gravity can affect time (general relativity), this is briefly explained so pay attention to that fact to understand what's going on. You don't need to be theoretical physicist to understand (but hey it wouldn't hurt). Ultimately this brings me to my negative point, while the movie excels at explaining the difficult but accepted scientific theories, it fails when showcasing the currently intangible areas of science. It forces the filmmaker to make artistic decisions on certain things that may come off too strange for the audience to accept. These scenes were really distracting for me, and I think it was for others as well because I'd hear giggles for something that was supposed to be taken seriously. Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't want to give away any plot points.Honestly though, Interstellar is truly a special film with grand ideas given in a deep narrative context. It's a blend that works almost perfectly. Interstellar is thought provoking and I am sure you will be having some long conversions with your friends and family afterwards. Cast, visuals, music, is the trifecta that will make this movie stick with you. Don't miss out on this one.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Interstellar

446,CowherPowerForever,"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, Old Age Should Burn and Rage at Close of day. Rage, Rage Against the Dying of the Light",8/10,9 November 2014,"One of the biggest directors today is back for another original film. After spending about years doing his Batman films he wanted to go back to some different genres. While I must admit this is not Nolan's best work, it certainly is still a fabulous film overall. This film is intense. That is the best word to describe what Christopher Nolan has done with this film. The following is my review of Interstellar.The film was written by Christopher Nolan(also director) and his brother Jonathan Nolan. Jonathan and his brother have worked together on most of Christopher's movie. While Christopher gets all the attention for the most part, Jonathan is one of the better writers out there today. I will not be spoiling the plot and will tread lightly on what I say about the plot because it is so important to see this film fresh. The Earth is falling apart and needs more resources. So, now comes the group of explorers who have to find a way to save us. Their mission is to go explore a warmhole and what it can do to save us. I really don't want to say much more as I already feel I said too much even though this is the basic description. The film is complex in nature, and many will have questions as they are leaving the theater. Repeating viewings at some point will be needed to fully understand. This gets everyone in the theater to think, which is what the Nolans want us to do. The story is deep in nature and asks important questions. With some good twists and turns in the film it is sure to leave most of us satisfied. The film does have faults. With a run time of nearly three hours, the film can drag in spots. It never hurts the film badly, but at one point in the film, I asked myself whether or not they needed to explain so much and thus dragging the film too long. The point of the film I'm speaking of is the ending. Overall, the Nolan Brothers deliver one heck of a Sci-Fi film that will leave us with many questions, but it also leaves us with more respect for what is next in space travel and the process that goes into it.Christopher Nolan directed this film as well. Nolan is use to delivering huge films that make the viewer fall into it. His films are always visually stunning and the same can easily be said here. Nolan takes a more practical approach to filming his movies instead of overusing CG, however in a film like this, much more CG is needed. Though it doesn't feel the CG was overused. His love for IMAX is another key aspect. Nolan has been directing films with the IMAX camera for many years now, and this might have the most IMAX footage with more than a hour of IMAX footage. These IMAX scenes are truly something to behold and you easily get lost in them. The visuals and his work behind the screen are fabulous, but acting is also a key factor and Nolan usually gets amazing work from his actors. Matthew McConaughey leads the film which also stars Anne Hathaway. There are some very emotional scenes in this film and McConaughey and the rest of the fabulous cast delivers those scenes amazingly. The entire cast works under Nolan's wing to their highest regard. This may in fact be the most well acted Nolan film yet, which is saying a great deal. With fabulous directing with many killer shots, and the outstanding acting, Nolan delivers another great effort on this film.The film was scored by a Christopher Nolan regular, Hans Zimmer. Zimmer is easily one of the best composers out there today. His scores are bombastic and add a great deal of much needed depth. The same can easily be said here. After listening to so many of Zimmer's scores, you often wonder if he will make a bad score that disappoints. I was somewhat worried about this aspect going into the film, but after leaving the film I walked away thinking his score was another masterpiece. In the more intense scenes the film offers, Zimmer's score transcends what anyone could have thought he was capable of. Those who love a great score like I do should leave the theater wanting to listen to it all one again. This is easily one of the best scores of 2014, and another fantastic addition to the career of Hans Zimmer.In closing, the film is not the best Christopher Nolan film. While I personally believe all of Nolan's movies are at least very good, this film falls somewhere in the Insomnia range. Not pure greatness, but certainly not bad or even average. Fans who want an immersive experience with the stunning IMAX shots and a good story, this is a must see for you. While there are some down spots in the film, they never bog the film down enough to truly hurt it to a point where it makes a film barely above average. This film is truly a must see, with so many aspects to enjoy.I went to an IMAX showing of this film, so I will talk about that as well. When Christopher Nolan directs a film, more recently it tends to be all out on the IMAX. Nolan is one of the few directors who actually enjoys shooting with the IMAX camera. The best way to watch this film is on an IMAX screen. Digital IMAX is what most locations have(and the one I watched this film on), and while it's not the same as a real IMAX screen, the depth it adds in not only picture quality, but sound is untouchable by versions below it. The extra price for IMAX can be a good bit more, but it is well worth the extra price, that is for sure.8/10",Interstellar
447,robert-259-28954,Interstellar Nonsense.,3/10,29 May 2015,"This excuse for a big budget thriller was the same movie as ""Gravity,"" with an equally unbelievable storyline to go with it. Gravity was a totally incredulous, high tech cartoon, with absolutely no emotional content. Interstellar is a high tech cartoon with soap opera emotion gone horribly awry. First, a great film has to create that illusive, ""willing suspension of disbelief."" Any film maker can make fantasmagorical imagery, but if it doesn't maintain some degree of reality, a movie can go south like a flock of frightened fowl. And that's what this overstepping scifi farce was, a turkey. A pseudo serious, tear jerking moon walk with a premise as weak and flawed as it's desire to be more than what it was... pure Hollywood drek dressed in melodramatic clothing... er, spacesuits.

448,moviemattb,The 2001: A Space Odyssey of our Time,10/10,2 January 2015,"I won't go into spoiler territory about this movie, because you have to see it. I thought ""Interstellar"" is a wonderful movie, and I do wish if I ever saw this movie in IMAX but seeing it in a regular theater was better than nothing. I hope I get to see the IMAX footage, once it comes to DVD and Blu Ray. So, with that said, I thought Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job on directing the movie as well as writing it with his brother Jonathan Nolan. The special effects in this movie are breathtaking with the use of its mixture of practical and CGI effects. Hans Zimmer's music is really wonderful, and there were parts of the music where it does make you think of the music in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The cinematography is so beautifully well shot, and I thought the cast did great. Matthew McConaughey does a great job as the main lead, while Anne Hathaway; Jessica Chastain; Mackenzie Foy and Michael Caine were all great in their own roles. The movie is also very well paced, and the movie does have that sort of realism where you can realize on what space is like besides another great movie about space, and that movie is of course ""Gravity."" I will admit that the ending was weak, but its by no means terrible or anything spectacular; it just is for what it is. ""Interstellar"" is definitely a work of art, and this is the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" of our time. I highly recommend this movie, and it is definitely a must see! I don't know what is my number one favorite movie of 2014, but I know that ""Interstellar"" is really on my best films of 2014 list. If you don't like this movie, I will respect that but I just couldn't help myself on how wonderful ""Interstellar"" really is, and really do wish if I ever see this movie in IMAX. I could be surprise if they reissue this movie back in to theaters and IMAX for another viewing. So, that is all I got to say about ""Interstellar"" and I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Really love this movie!",Interstellar

450,jdonalds-5,For SiFi Fans I guess,2/10,13 November 2014,"The theater sound was somehow screwed up for this movie. The dialog was very difficult to hear and the ""background"" music was way too loud. In spite of that just enough dialog got through to follow the story, but the sound problems weren't the real problem.I guess if you're a serious SiFi fan you might like this movie. I am not a big SiFi fan (other than the plausible Star Trek sort). I didn't enjoy this movie.There was no real foundation for why the earth was failing; you're supposed to guess. There was no background to suggest power sources for space vehicles that would last so long. There was no explanation for how the sleep modules worked. In fact there was no foundation or explanation for pretty much anything in the movie. You were just supposed to believe.There is no preparation for the flight. Cooper is an experienced pilot but the crew doesn't seem to know each other so they spent no time together before the multi-year flight. You're just supposed to accept all of that and look past it.Near the end Cooper ejects himself from his space craft out into space in his space suit. He's in a distant galaxy accessible through a worm hole but the last we knew he seems to have gotten trapped in a black hole. There is nothing but hocus pocus that has him land in a hospital on a space station at the end of the movie; no rescue attempt, nothing. You're just supposed to believe. I don't mind wild scenarios but they have to be plausible at least. Maybe even 50% plausible?I truly had a difficult time sitting through the movie and was glad when it was over. I wish I had stayed home and watched reruns of The Big Bang Theory. The movie was a waste of time and money.",Interstellar
451,annuskavdpol,A great hopeful movie about a family of scientists,7/10,23 January 2015,"This movie, Interstellar was a great movie about a family of scientists who try to save the world and actually do. The story seemed to be a constant battle, always ending on a good note. The special effects of the black hole and a few of the planets was sensational. The story-line and dialogue was kept very simple and followed a very clear logical storyboard. This seemed to compel the audience and mesmerize them. Almost like being in a trance. While I sat in the IMAX movie theater in Victoria City - the whole theater with people was full and not a person moved from their seats throughout the duration of the whole movie. Furthermore, the whole audience was quiet and listened closely to the dialogue of the movie. The whole movie was captivating. I liked the simple space ships, and outfits that the space travelers wore. I also like the overall simplicity of the exploration of space. The space ships were small, the packages of left data in orange bags in the ocean were easy to be identified and everything seemed very functional and practical. This felt safe. This movie seems to have been a symbol of our future. One of simplicity externally and complexity internally. I also liked the fact that aliens were not introduced into this movie - but rather the notion of the evolved human being, being able to communicate and through new dimensions. It was a positive and happy movie about a hopeful future. One of change and one of humanity.",Interstellar
452,Barev2013,back To The Future reloads with a Bigger budget,5/10,23 April 2015,"INTERSTELLAR. Back to the Future, reloaded with a bigger budget image1.jpegINTERSTELLAR: viewed at Berlin Sony Ctr. Cinemaxx, FEB. 2015-- Cutting edge pseudoscience from Christopher Nolan. Nolan is noted for making wannabe sophisticated big budget big star films with big special effects that bedazzle the masses but don't hold up to serious scrutiny. interstellar is a perfect example. In this one Nolan plays around with advanced notions of theoretical physics and cosmology such as Einstein's Space-Time Relativity and wormholes leading into parallel universes. To lend authority to this exalted wool pull he has consulted with noted Cal Tech physicist Kip Thorne, the go-to scientist for serious reflection on wormholes and possible other universes. What emerges is a pot-pouring of cutting edge wild ideas not too convincingly thrashed through the cosmic mix-master and coupled with a Back to the Future Midwest farm family back story that is fairly entertaining if you don't think about it too hard and just call it Science Fantasy, like Nolans other pictures. Last years Best Actor Oscar winner, Matthew McConnaughry, is back from his winning cowboy with Aids turn to star as a good ole country boy farmer who happens to do a little astronaughting on the side. He is engaged by a most unlikely Michael Csine (-think Alfie-) in the role of a super scientist leading an ultra-secret interstellar project designed to find a new inhabitable planet for the remains of mankind to escape to, because as we learned from the early scenes back on the farm, the Earth is in the final stages of environmental collapse.The reason Caine's project is so tiptop secret is that they don't want to set off a global panic on our dying planet.Well, to make a very long story short Mac goes off in search of an appropriate wormholes way out there in the greater interstellar beyond accompanied by a beautiful co scientist on board (Ann Hathaway) finds his wormhole, lives to tell about it, and miraculously returns to the original country homestead where he finds that due to Einsteinian relativistic time bending he is now younger than his grandchildren. (e =mc2!) In Part II maybe a few surviving earthlings will be shipped out to beyond the wormhole to carry on the propagation of our species on an exoplanet that is not dying. The details of how this is all worked out would require a report longer than the picture itself. But I must say that, at a commercial screening with a German audience, I was mildly amused and even found Mr. McConnaughry, whom I normally cannot stand, passably acceptable in a role that suits him. Old time actor John Lithgow was gramps in the rocking chair on the porch.Give it five stars out of ten for half speed (Half Fast Science)",Interstellar
453,heyimmyx,"Immy's review : Powerful, beautiful, mind numbing brilliance",9/10,16 May 2020,"I really loved this movie. It's one of those movies that pulls you in from beginning to end, renders your emotions and thought process, makes you cry, confused, relieved, and then as it finishes leaves you completely numb as you attempt not to think about it for the rest of the day. Although this was directed to a mass audience, this actually sparks conversation and takes your brain to a cognitive state, like with many other Nolan films.
The premise is simple. Earth is on the brink of extinction due to dust bowel-like clouds wreaking havoc on the planets crops and decreasing resources. There's limited time left. Cooper, a struggling farmer and ex-pilot, along with his daughter Murph, stumble across a NASA facility where he's enlisted to board a mission to space and search for a suitable and efficient planet for the future of humanity to inhabit. Although the premise is simple, the way that it's done is phenomenally complex and beautiful.
The plot is constantly engaging due to Nolan's use of unexplained phenomenons throughout, which leaves you constantly guessing what is at play. I admit some of the concepts were heavy and hard to get your brain around, but they somehow make sense in the end, and in the way you least expect it, making for some shocking and moving revelations. The build up of the story is slow but well paced, building up to an unparalleled end that leaves you feeling somewhat sad, but content. The actors were always engaging and very talented, especially Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain. The effects and editing were beautiful. I thought that some scenes were so aesthetic and extremely pleasant to look at, particularly the wormhole scenes.
Nolan invites you to take a different outlook on our reality and dimensions, and to question what's really there. Time is a very prominent theme here, as the film portrays the tragic consequences of lost time on humanity and our relationships. This left a very strong uncertainty and eerie but suspenseful tone to the movie, as time is constantly chasing our main characters. I also liked the theme of betrayal, particularly in two significant characters. Although what they did was bad, the movie thankfully doesn't paint them as villains but two humans whose fear of these unforeseen circumstances and uncertainty got the best of them, painting a rather significant picture on human emotions and interactions. Although on the surface this is a Sci Fi thriller, this is only the wrapping of the emotional and heartfelt core within, which explores the pure love between humans, and how even love can break through the barriers of time and space. There are some out there who may find the 'love is quantifiable' theory cheesy, but I think there's more to it than that. Nolan invites us to look at love and human relationships as the driving force of everything. Cooper's and Murph's relationship come to symbolise this.
Overall a superb, powerful and rare epic that deserves to be more than just a sci fi movie. It's intelligence lies in the fact it puts love, family and drama within an intelligent sci-fi / thriller setting in which so many different concepts are explored and themes appear to overlap each other, making for a well balanced and beautiful film. The reason it scores 9 and not 10 is because I don't think it matches the sheer excellence and intrigue of other Nolan films like inception, but it's still a masterpiece in its own right. Highly recommend.",Interstellar
454,Balthazar-5,What a massive disappointment,6/10,13 November 2014,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.",Interstellar
455,mitchell5954,Modern 2001: A Space Odyssey!,6/10,13 November 2014,"Interstellar is basically the more intellectual version of The Core from 2003 with much better effects. The story is very similar. In both movies the Earth is dying. To save it a secret organization funded by the government assembles a team of scientists, of which most are used for cannon fodder, to save the planet. The only differences are that instead of traveling to the core of the Earth they go into space. Plus, Interstellar is a more intellectual and thought-provoking piece than a summer blockbuster which was what The Core was. There are many similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well. I think Nolan really tried to make this the modern 2001 and his fans really want this to be too. Overall, I think this film is better than 2001 besides the ending which I'll get to. This film has better character thus more of a reason to be invested. Interstellar is definitely an ambitious movie for Nolan even more than Inception was. I think it succeeds in most of what it set out to do, but does fall a bit short in a couple areas.The general story is very simple, though it gets vastly more complicated towards the climax. The Earth is slowly dying due to pollution and the only viable food growing now is corn. A farmer named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former astronaut who dreams of going into space, is recruited by NASA who the public think is shut down but is secretly still getting funded by the government as a back-up plan. Cooper and a team of astronauts, including a woman named Brand (Anne Hathaway), travel to Saturn where an artificial wormhole in space has opened-up that will take them to another galaxy. In this galaxy there are a few potentially habitable worlds they hope to explore to save humanity.The main selling point is the effects which are breathtaking. Like films like Gravity or Jurassic Park this is a film that you should see in theaters just to experience the awesome effects. The film sounds great and has a terrific score; though it can get make scenes seem too over-dramatic at times. I will say that this is a better-looking movie than Avatar. Plus, unlike Avatar, Interstellar has more to offer than just the spectacle.The acting is also superb. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast all do fantastic performance-wise and I did like all of the characters. I even enjoyed the side cast even though most of them were there just to die and provide drama. I think this has to do with the actors and how well they sold the characters.However, I do have a couple issues in regards to the story. The story itself is great but it could've been executed better in some areas. While I enjoyed the side character, most had no reason to be there and were basically used for cannon fodder. Also the film was too long. There were many scenes and story elements that felt irrelevant. When they go through the worm hole and enter the other galaxy they have three worlds to choose from and they go to every single one which takes at least twenty minutes for each. While, from a visual perspective, it was amazing seeing all these different worlds and it did provide some drama. However, in terms of the overall the story it felt mostly like padding. The point is the movie did not need to be almost three hours.Lastly, there was one story element I was not really a fan of which ties into the ending, which is the ""ghost"" subplot. I know it has to do with time which is one of the main plot elements of the film. However, the way it's presented in the film is a bit weird and silly compared to the rest of the film. Plus they didn't explain it as well as they should've making it rather confusing. I know complicated is virtually Nolan's trademark, but I still felt that he made the film more complicated than it needed to be. It is already a strong film without the twist at the ending involving the ""ghost"" plot point. It really felt like Nolan was trying for a 2001 ending. Even though I like this film more I do think the ending to 2001 was done better than the ending of Interstellar.Overall, Interstellar is a pretty well-done space adventure. It was an amazing visual ride, the acting was great, I liked the majority of the characters, and it had some intriguing ideas and good drama. However, some of its ideas aren't explored or explained enough I felt. Many of the side characters, while likable, feel shoehorned in. Plus the film went on a bit too long and the ending could've been better. Even with those issues I still highly recommend the film and suggest you see it in theaters. It's a great experience.",Interstellar
456,mitchell5954,I Good Space Adventure,6/10,25 April 2019,"Interstellar is basically the more intellectual version of The Core from 2003 with much better effects. The story is very similar. In both movies the Earth is dying. To save it a secret organization funded by the government assembles a team of scientists, of which most are used for cannon fodder, to save the planet. The only differences are that instead of traveling to the core of the Earth they go into space. Plus, Interstellar is a more intellectual and thought-provoking piece than a summer blockbuster which was what The Core was. There are many similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well. I think Nolan really tried to make this the modern 2001 and his fans really want this to be too. Interstellar is definitely an ambitious movie for Nolan even more than Inception was. I think it succeeds in most of what it set out to do, but does fall a bit short in a couple areas.The main selling point is the effects which are breathtaking.

459,AJ4F,"Not much of a ""climate change"" statement",6/10,29 March 2015,"I watched this in large part hoping it would emphasize climate change and other human failings, but it did so in only a vague way, and stressed the point that Man is an ""explorer"" more than a ""caretaker.""I found it odd that they put a scientist named Mann on a frozen planet and had him fake data, which seemed like a jab at a famous climatologist pilloried by right-wingers. Are film-makers so cynical and profit-driven that they have to appease every element of society?I found the plot-line ponderous in many scenes, with temporary confusion about who was on what ship as they scouted out the planets. The guy who aged 23 years while they mucked around in the water wasn't explained very well. Did he go into hibernation? Otherwise, how did he not deplete their food supply?Other notable flaws were: Driving through a corn field to chase a drone with no fear of damaging the truck, let alone even seeing the drone with corn that high, and using a laptop to boot. Then he lets his daughter land the drone on her first try as if it's just a toy he was chasing. Too many cutesy Hollywood tactics. The blocky metal robots seemed fragile and impractical for getting around a physical environment. I guess the metal was impervious to damage somehow. They also pegged the Earth's population at 6 billion but it's well over 7 now. Unclear when all the action was going down.The redeeming part of the film was its clever time travel aspect. All in all, I wasn't overly impressed but it kept me entertained. The concept could have been executed a lot better with the same basic storyline.",Interstellar

They no longer feel lonely with each other. This movie also reminds people to protect the environment. When the environment of the earth becomes one of the worst in the movie, people will also be greatly threatened. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to think carefully and deal with it carefully. With the continuous advancement of science and technology, do not ignore our nature. From now on, we love science, love nature, and have a heart of advocating science.

461,alon-dar1,"the movie for the small brained ""thinking man""",4/10,28 November 2014,"I appreciate Nolan, all in all he made great films, but ""Interstellar"" and ""Avatar"" were kind of fakes, small stories with old ideas that are very common in science fiction literature and sf movies for decades, wrapped nicely in cg and dramatic music, creating a feeling of enlightenment in any idiot who never read a book or knows not what real imagination is. I never thought of Matthew McConaughey as a real actor, but in this film he does a wonderful job, no one can play the idiotic role of the genius farmer as he does, dramatically suffering just as Nolan directed him, any other actor would have burst in a crazed laughter at the idiotic script, but Matthew, a ""thinking actor"" did exactly what was expected from him. must respect him for that. few words about the music, there were all the right notes and volume to make this flick seem like a ""serious"" one. but the music itself was created on a very cheap emotional theme. Feels like the budget for this movie was about 10 million $, i cannot see any extra dollar that was spent as giving any result.

But Interstellar was exactly what you wanted in a space odyssey film and more. Realistic, well-shot, detailed, atmospheric. It transcends the typical sci-fi action blockbuster, captivating with its sheer scope and mystery.And Interstellar has what many other ambitious sci-fi films lack - human drama. Interstellar has actual, likable characters on screen instead of one-dimensional tools to move the plot.There are numerous problems. The early exposition dialog is obvious. It was difficult to here people sometimes. There are some hammy moments, or failed attempts at insight. And your mileage on the ending may vary. But sometimes, you just can't nitpick every little thing about a movie, wishing it was tailor-made to suit you. Overall, I thought it was a great, beautiful sci-fi film. Watch it in the theaters while you still can!

468,voyou-703-655350,"Inaudible, unclear, unwatchable.",3/10,17 November 2014,"The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals.",Interstellar

Matthew McConaughey poorly acts the same boring, hick character he plays in every movie he was ever in (similar to nick cage). The plot is just lame and way to retarded to follow or even attempt to make realistic or interesting. Apparently getting sucked into a black hole sends you to some library of time... I wont say anymore than that because it gets even stupider. Just a bad bad bad movie. There will be only one Kubrick...and its not you mr.Nolan!

472,jdhb-768-61234,Pretentious and mediocre,4/10,12 April 2020,"Interstellar is not a bad film but neither is it the great one suggested by some reviewers.The basic premise is reasonable although the early coincidences are somewhat farfetched. Nonetheless, the story makes a degree of sense for the first hour, even if it becomes a bit confused at times, but then descends into mostly confusion and ultimately implausibility and even incomprehensibility. It really falls down is in the mumbled dialogue and loud and dreadful 'musical' accompaniment that frequently renders the mumbling almost completely inaudible, even if it could be understood. Whoever is it that thinks loud noise enhances dramatic action, particularly when it drowns whatever dialogue there is ?McConaughey and Hathaway do almost nothing but mumble and the only bright spot is the far better elocution of other cast members, especially Michael Caine until, that is, he's on his death bed and his words fade into incomprehensibility too.This is a film of grand designs but poor execution. It could easily have been a true gem but, in the end, is just another pretentious and mediocre film made by a director far too enamoured of the assorted technological gimmicks available to him. The phrase ""Less is More"" springs to mind and that is certainly the case here.I give it a mark of 4 because it's a decent idea that could have real traction. On the basis of the film itself and it's pretty limited script, plus the lack of audibility, I'd be stretched to give it 1.Almost forgot. What more obvious ending could there have been to point to a potential sequel ? What a dreary, boring yet almost inevitable thought.",Interstellar

The film let the most real and warm feelings and waiting for the human nature into the space migration such a huge and full of tragic human epic. In a grand narrative that encapsulates sincere emotion, which is what Nolan is good at, the manipulation and expression is no doubt superb. In this film, the sense of mission to save the children and the future of mankind, and the deep feeling between father and daughter to wait for each other, constitute a classical dramatic conflict in opposition, and almost always as the protagonist's motivation to advance the story.",Interstellar
474,akshay-ak-kumar,A Good film but too much to digest !!,7/10,7 March 2015,"I've always admired Christopher Nolan's work. He is a rare film maker who can make the summer action blockbuster like the Dark Knight Rises or make an intellectual thriller like Inception. He is at ease while making both the types.However, with Interstellar, Nolan is pushing the envelope and the end product didn't leave me much happy.Interstellar has an interesting premise of man searching another planet in space where mankind can survive as earth is dying. But Nolan and his writer brother Johnathan fill the story with lots of science and theories like Relativity, Time Travel, Worm Hole, etc. It became difficult to comprehend after a point of time what is exactly happening in the film. So there are points in the film where its slow and boring and many of us were lost.I felt like where Inception was pure fantasy, Interstellar is Nolan's take on time travel and related theories which might be true. But as an audience, we need a bit of entertainment at the end of the day.Technically the movie is brilliant like all Nolan's films have been till date. The movie has some breath taking scenes and I've to admire Nolan's vision of the future, space and the planets. Its the story where he flatters. However, like all Nolan's films, this film ends with a hope.The performances were excellent. Mathew McConaughey is outstanding as Cooper. His scenes with his daughter Murph played by Mackenzie Roy are sweet and touching. Also, please see the scene when he comes back to the space craft after 23 years and sees the videos sent by his son.Jessica Chastain as the older Murph is excellent. Hathaway, Caine, Lithgow and Damon are good in their roles. Overall, its a good film with lots of science which might be difficult for us to digest.",Interstellar

She is a terrible actress and we have been conned into thinking she was ever anything but.The movis is not bad....slightly overrated. Why is it that women always have to cry in movies and in life. I think that women can be equally as string as men and we have to show them as blubbering idiots. This needs to stop cos there is only one thing worse than an ugly woman on screen and that is the same ugly woman crying.So many things wrong with the proposed concept of this movie. But it was entertaining even if it's science seemed way off.

477,RMS1949,Good not great !!!!!,7/10,17 November 2014,"Gee, another recent SciFi/Superhero movie that fanboys think is the greatest movie ever made. LOL, if nothing else they are consistent.It is a ""good"" movie with some great visuals. the storyline though is a smörgåsbord of everything scientific. They threw in everything, even if they are unproven theories, They used, time travel, black hole travel, alternate universe and frozen hibernation, and topped it off with a underlying human story that Lifetime network would love.Despite all that, it was entertaining, although I hated Matt Damon's character, it was over the top.Nice to see on a Big screen with popcorn, again a good movie, not great.",Interstellar

479,midas-jacobs,loved it,10/10,5 June 2015,"The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper and Anne Hathaway as Brand. Cooper is a talented engineer, but now he is working as a farmer. He does this job together with his son and tractors who he programmed. Oneday his daugther tells him that there is a ghost in the house. The so called 'ghost'gives Cooper coordinates, which lead him to a secret base. In this base he is given the chance to join an expedition to space. Cooper accepts this offer, but he goes to a place in space where 1 hour on that planet is the same as seven years on earth...So as I already have said, this movie stars Mattew McConaughey. He is pretty good in this movie, and I really liked his character. But Anne's character I didn't like as much, I found her rather annoying at sometimes. I really liked TARS and CASE, they is some kind of robots, I tought they were a nice touch. The kid actor of Murph was also good. And now, the special effects and the directing. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan, he is my favorite director. He has made a lot of other good movies, that's one of the reasons I wanted to watch the movie. The special effects are also really good, and I can understand why this movie got his Oscar for it. The dialogue is also amazing. And I really loved the realism of the movie (like the no sound in space stuff)Overall this movie is really good and it has a good plot. Also some good tension between the characters. And at some moments there are some exiting moments. So go watch it and maybe some more of Nolans films.",Interstellar
480,Macleanie,Boring and Flat,5/10,18 June 2019,"Far far too long and has too many plot holes for a film trying desperately to cover every possible angle. 'Interstellar' started positively, but in soon this escalated into something which can only be applauded for its sheer cinematography and effects. The rest was quite frankly fluff ruined by poor explanations, we're led to believe this farmer was once an incredible astronaut who has to have wormholes explained to him. The twist to the movie was unfortunately clear to see from pretty much quarter of the way through which really ruined the finale. The last on screen moments also where seemed rushed and we're misguided as to what the real focus should have been. Overall the movie was mesmerising in very few places, but when done, it was done well. For the rest, it disappointed greatly, mainly being boring, flat and really lacking in memorable moments to make it the blockbuster it should have been.

481,JeanMoniette,Brilliantly executed but nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.,7/10,19 October 2020,"You already know what's good about the movie, so let's look at the not so good: it's full of hamfisted plot points.Arguably, it starts off a fun causal loop which I tend to usually enjoy as plot devices. However it quickly devolves into to fairly poorly executed exposition tricks such as an engineer explaining to the pilot the very basics of the flight is just been selected for? Or the very basic of gravity that any astronaut would know about??? Why?You also have a scene in there where the lead takes down an Indian military predator drone with only two young children, a laptop and a Pringle cantenna.So it would be rather wise of the people qualify this as being highbrow 'hard' science fiction to eat a bit of humble pie, as a lot of the story is no more intelligent than than say, your average avengers movie. This isn't primer.Regardless, the direction and the photography are so brilliantly executed that it's impossible not to give this movie at least a seven * rating simply for the camera work and the vfx. It is not, however, the 2001 killer some rave about, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.",Interstellar

483,drawlife,It's okay at best.,6/10,9 November 2014,"Interstellar was one of my most anticipated films of 2014, and it is for a lack of a better word, underwhelming. I do like Christopher Nolan as a director, he's a great story teller and he knows how to make a movie. But this is two films in a row which I've been let down from him. Interstellar is not the massive dud that was The Dark Knight Rises. It's more of a mixed bag. What I loved in this film is the father and daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph. Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy provide the film's emotional impact. Their relationship is very tender and have a sweetness to them. It's great to watch and is arguably the film's strongest element. I liked everyone's performances all around, Interstellar contains more than a few strong performances. McConaughey is great, as he displays his fine acting and you feel sorry for this character leaving his children behind. The film provides another emotional punch when he watches video messages of his children Tom(Casey Affleck) and Murphy(Jessica Chastain) grow up over time. Hathaway is decent too, she's conflicted, and trying to keep her emotions at bay. Ellen Burstyn has a small role, but it's a good one too. Oh the two robot assistants TARS and CASE were very amusing to watch and provides some levity and humor to the film. The one that really stood out to me is Jessica Chastain. She is the one who shines bright. Her performance as the older Murph is very subtle and provides the right amount of emotion with each scene. I always thought Nolan's main weakness was his characterization on women, but that's starting to change. I strongly think she deserves an Oscar nomination at best.The visuals are spectacular. Each planet they visit to see if it's inhabitable for the human race is bafflingly stunning. The planet that was covered in water is my favorite out of the bunch. If you have the chance to see it, definitely check it out on IMAX. It's gorgeous to look at. Like the film Gravity, it's stunningly beautiful. The film is technically very well made and well shot, as expected in a Christopher Nolan film. The science isn't what bother's me in the film, it wasn't too hard to follow, in the end I got the gist of it. What bothered me was the mid to last half of the film. Although all the space scenes were great to look it, it provides some of the film's dullest moments with very dull dialog. Exposition is required in a film like this, but it was handled very clumsily, compared to Nolan's Inception and The Prestige. Without going too much in the spoiler zone, when Matt Damon's character shows up, immediately after his character is introduced I knew where the plot was headed. This is where I was really irritated in the film. The chunk of that film is very unnecessary and only slowed the film down for me. I thought it provided some very unnecessary conflict, and very much has a been there and done that feel to it. Towards the end I thought the conclusion of this film was pretty intriguing, and kind of wowed me in a way. I know some people out there are probably calling out it's scientific inaccuracy but I took it for what it was and it's quite cool how Nolan, his brother, and his crew were able to conclude the film with its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can't measure in scientific terms. Love. It saved the film for me.6.8/10",Interstellar
484,justbob1982,"Hard science and human drama, married with the help of cutting-edge VFX",7/10,12 March 2017,"Version I saw: UK IMAX releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Christopher Nolan is one of the most trusted directors in the film industry, with a flawless record of large box-office profits. As a result, when he asks for $160 million to make an epic sci-fi original project, studio execs set aside their usual reservations and stump up the cash without question.Interstellar is visually spectacular, with digital imaging grounded in the hard physics equations of scientific consultant Kip Thorne. However, it also marries this with human drama by exploring the personal impact of the phenomena discussed. As a result, we get dramatic close-up scenes of both star Matthew McConaughey and major support Anne Hathaway, highlighting their considerable acting talents.Admittedly, it isn't Nolan's best, as high a bar as that is. Interstellar starts too slowly, and the climax is just preposterous, arguably throwing away all the scientific credibility it had earned up to that point. It is suitably poetic though, with the right emotional impact (supported by Hans Zimmer's excellent church organ score), and as I say, visually breathtaking.I am grateful to Nolan for using his industry cred for pushing through work like this, of a type we don't see much any more.",Interstellar
485,tvdefrancesco,One of The Greatest Movies Ever Made,10/10,13 February 2021,I absolutely love this movie. It is one of the most re-watchable movies ever made. The heart wrenching score is absolutely epic. Matthew McConaughey's performance is brilliant. The love he has for his daughter Murph drives the film. I can't help but cry when they are finally reunited at the end. I love the color pallet chosen for the film and the camera angles. The story is phenomenal and so is the acting. The CGI is also great. It's crazy to think Stephen Spielberg chose other projects after reading a script like the one Jonathan Nolan wrote but it was for our benefit because his brother Christopher Nolan directed an absolute masterpiece. This is easily the best Sci-fi film ever made and in my opinion it is in the Top 10 for greatest films ever made period. Nolan has made so many excellent films but this is his best.,Interstellar
486,xpat-55192,Scrapes into a five star score.,5/10,15 October 2021,"A top-shelf cast including cameos saw the talent push it to a 5-star score, but I was disappointed.I thought 2hours and 40minutes bled the story dry and the movie floundered down the straight to the finish in profound oxygen debt.Personally, I was impressed by Prince William's philosophy yesterday 14/10/21 when he said (I paraphrase) instead of looking for other planets to ruin, we should focus our energy on fixing the mess we have made of Earth.

487,s_campanale,Nolan enters wormhole to go back to the 1970s but cosmic forces bend everything badly out of shape,7/10,8 November 2014,"The 70s, it seems, is where the cinema zeitgeist is at the moment. From bleak sparse thrillers ('Jack Reacher' – 'A walk among the tombstones') to Horror (Under the Skin' -'You're Next' and 'The Guest') to Sci-Fi ('Guardians of the Galaxy) to anarchic comedy ('Wolf of Wall Street') everyone is wearing retro. Now it's Christopher 'The Messiah' Nolan 's turn with a brave and ambitious stab at the cerebral sci-fi of the early 70s. A difficult enough genre at the best of times ('cold' and 'dry' are kind terms, 'pretentious', 'boring' and 'painfully dull' less kind) it takes someone of Nolan's current stature to sell such a project today. Has it worked? Well yes and no.The story is, like the originals, very hazy and has Humanity slowly dying out from nature itself turning against us, something we see through the rather limited prism of a dirt farm in the mid-west (dirt farm and dirt cheap!) Although the fate of all humanity is at stake we concentrate only one family, that of widowed ex-Nasa pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his unnaturally smarty pants daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy as a kid, Jessica Chastain as an adult) who through some weird messaging from beyond end up with boffin Dr Brand (Michael Caine) After a very long time we finally blast off on 'mankind's last hope', an exploration ship that goes through a wormhole that has very handily just appeared near Saturn. From there it's off to three planets, 'water world' 'ice world' (where Matt Damon appears as 'poorly sketched but necessary human antagonist') and finally 'rock world'. Then Cooper, who despite all of humanity being in his hands thinks more about his daughter than anything else (Selfish? Not really because love is the 5th dimension apparently) leaves his co-pilot Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and leaps into a giant black hole which, rather than utterly destroying him, leads him to some sort of time-gate built by humanities distant descendants who have learnt to master the 4h dimension so that he can set everything in motion. Then there's possibly the most forced happy ending in cinema history and what could be a sequel lead in.The original 70's movies were roughly divided between pessimistic (We're all frakked and we deserve it) and the optimistic (Humanity will thrive no matter what and there are higher forces out there helping us out too) and 'Interstellar' falls squarely into the second category. . As many have pointed out the main players (Cooper-Amelia-Murphy-Dr Brand, the red shirted crew) are one-dimensional cyphers (as they were then) but here Nolan has found his forte anyway since it can be argued that the same is true of all Nolan movie characters. It's clinical coldness it counter-weighs with 'emotional heft', also known as 'schmaltz' and 'cheese'. Not quite as sick bag inducing as the absurd 'Gravity' it still manages to raise plenty of groans and face palms from the get-go. Everyone gets a chance to cry and weep and make important, unlikely speeches about the power of love, the nature of the human spirit, etc. Also a lot of major short cuts are taken with the science especially towards the end where it reaches such heights of tenuous straw grabbing that you could imagine Adam West and Burt Ward's Batman and Robin making similar deductions (""The message said 'Stop!' And what do you do when you 'stop'? – 'You Wait!"" – ""Exactly Robin! Wait- WEIGHT! Weight is obviously the secret to time!"" ""Holy time machine Batman, we have to use gravity to stop time!"" ""Exactly Robin, that's what Dr Brand was missing all the time!"")What the 70s sci-fi films lacked in narrative cohesion or character building they made up for in striking images and music and this film delivers that in abundance. The movie's look is carefully designed to evoke the 70s, complete with that 'grainy' 70mm film some people are complaining about and a design aesthetic that is 40 years old. While impressive in its recreation, a lot of it looks frankly ridiculous in 2014, especially the 'walking block' robots that became such an integral part of the tale. Even the special effects all look practical (or are CGI made to look practical or a combination of both) and ships look like models clumsily blue screened and matted that move at odd jerky right angles (on controlled pole arms) over painted backdrops. Again, this is wonderfully nostalgic and accurate to the source but it looks cheap and amateurish to a mainstream audience. Thematically also it has that 70s combo of 'Space Race optimism' (when we all believed we'd be having holiday's on Mars by 2000) and 'New Age' philosophy, both lingering hangovers from the 60s.The brooding Organ led music by Hans Zimmer (who else) is a good imitation of Phillip Glass and suits the film well, doing a lot of the 'talking' for it. Acting wise it is a lot of familiar faces really going through the motions but then Nolan movies are never acting tour-de- forces.The Nolan brothers are to be congratulated on attempting to do something like this and to explore some (sadly) rarely visited themes including the power of wonder and striving that fuels science and exploration, mankind not being isolated but part of a greater unity we can perceive but barely understand (yet) the bonds of love in a Universal context, (etc) even when the result comes out looking rather too silly and melodramatic, melding stony seriousness with frankly ridiculous events and impossible coincidences. One to watch, but with a big pinch of salt!",Interstellar
488,coljam21,Total nonsense,1/10,20 December 2014,"When I saw this was directed by Chris Nolan I said there's no way I can miss this movie. Then I checked out the ratings on IMDb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep. This movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future, however when cooper goes to his daughter's school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube TV in the classroom. Huh? Tube tvs can't be found anywhere in 2014 yet we're expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future.Also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? They made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and that's it. OK so what's the point. Going through the worm hole was OK but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical. Like out of a Disney fairytale. This film was filled with A listers but fell flat. Matt Damon's character was totally predictable and so was the ending. I really don't understand the appeal and high ratings.",Interstellar

490,mjplysaght,"Very ambitious film, but it feels like you're in a science test",7/10,27 January 2017,"Christopher Nolan has always approached intriguing subject matter in his films. His niche seems to be the 'thinking man's film' and Interstellar is no exception.In this dystopian setting, where mankind is enduring severe blight, Matthew McConaughey stumbles upon a team of NASA scientists and must part from his family to find a suitable planet through a wormhole for the human race to migrate to.When it comes to performance, McConaughey knocks it out of the park. Scenes like watching his family age before him as he sits through 23 years of messages after falling victim to drastic time dilation, it's heartbreaking.The visuals and concepts of this film are absolutely breathtaking. From depictions of wormholes to black holes to five-dimensional tesseracts, this film certainly takes us out of our comfort zones.The downside, unfortunately, is that every character has some preachy, philosophical soliloquy ready to go in each scene. The dialogue, especially when they get into space, is incredibly technical and scientifically specific. Your average punter wouldn't be able to keep up with the equations and probabilities presented here. Sure, they will be stunned by the visuals, but that's about it.Also, the very notion that the fate of humanity is saved thanks to the power of love? Seriously? In a film where they literally got assistance from a renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne to help them with scientific accuracy, the chorus of a Huey Lewis song is the solution? That affected my investment in the film big-time.Aside from this, this film is a spectacle to behold. It drags a bit but it's worth it just for the visuals.",Interstellar
491,politehere,My Personal Experience of Interstellar,5/10,20 March 2015,"Sometimes I wonder if swimming against the tide is the right thing to do, but with this movie I am not going to hesitate in giving it a low score despite all the raving 10/10 reviews. I'll just share my personal experience with you. First off, I didn't really like the characters and my biggest problem was with the lead character. I was hoping to see Tom Cruise, because I had gotten accustomed to seeing him in two of the best sci-fi movies, i.e. Oblivion and The Edge of Tomorrow. Simply put, the lead character didn't have the looks.The country side scenes the movie began with bored me to tears. It's not a good idea to start a movie with boring country life. Most sci-fi films go well with a New York City than with a country side setting.I couldn't really connect with or care about the main characters, much less with the much discussed ""humanity"" for that matter. Their performances were wooden at best. Also, Since English is a foreign language to me, I had an extremely hard time understanding what was being said. The characters were mumbling all the time and their voices were muffled by the ponderous music. The music score was terrible, unemotional and gave me a headache. I got the main dialogs though.I was literally dozing off throughout the movie. Three hours is simply not an appropriate length of time for a movie, because thanks to the technology, most people have a short attention span and quickly lose interest.What I found remarkable in Interstellar were the scenes that effectively captured the negligibility of mankind when compared to the entire universe or the seemingly endless surface of a planet. Scenes like showing a spaceship float in an endless ocean or them arguing with each other on the surface of a frozen planet were grand. In spite of this, while such scenes were jaw-dropping, they were soulless and uninteresting. Now I know making those scenes is technically difficult, but I've gotten so used to seeing more remarkable, complex and colorful special effects in Marvel superhero movies (Transformers, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Avengers, etc.) that the masterful special effects in Interstellar simply didn't deliver, and I'm saying this as an average sci-fi fan and not as a CGI expert.The plot rather kept my attention up until they said who had made the three-dimensional space, which was simply unbelievable and took the movie to the realm of nonsense. Had they said it was designed by the Ancient Roman Gods it would have been more believable than this lousy explanation. They should have stopped at ""a higher being we cannot understand"" or a simple ""we do not know if it was even designed and was not simply a working of the natural laws of physics"". Not to mention the ludicrous idea that the whole ""intelligent design"" to save the mankind revolves around a kid's bedroom.The movie had an emotional ending, which I liked and I think it was its strong side, but it failed to make me all emotional like Titanic. I'm fascinated by such things as wormholes, space-time, etc. and I tend to read a lot about such things and thus I expected much more from a movie that dealt with my favorite subject than just trying to explain to me what a wormhole does using a piece of paper, which instead of making me feel smart, made me feel dumb and insulted, because anyone who goes to see Interstellar should already be familiar with at least the ""basics"". What happened inside the wormhole could have been depicted in a far more imaginative way than just spiraling dust, which made it look like a cheap sci-fi flick. If the movie had a better editing and inessential parts were cut out I would've given it a higher score. If there's anything Interstellar excels at it's taking boredom to a whole new level.I give it 5/10.",Interstellar
492,Tanay_LKO,"INTERSTELLAR - Beautiful and ""Believable, even when its not""",9/10,21 November 2014,"""We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments these moments when we dared to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the 'unknown' known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still 'pioneers'. And we've barely begun And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our 'destiny' lies above us.""INTERSTELLAR travel – a journey of exploration of spaces ""situated in stars"". However, the literal meaning falls short of summarizing the happening of an entire film that is been deemed as 'paradigm shifting cinematic phenomenon' worldwide by viewers, critics and (most of the) scientists alike. Toying with the idea of 'we didn't inhabit Earth to stay, but to leave it someday' – this science-fiction drama tried to browse through the possibility that ""end of Earth, shall not be the end of mankind"" for which a team of space-explorers travel from the degrading Earth through a 'wormhole to find a potentially habitable planet that could sustain humanity', with the help of futuristic artificial intelligence based robots and neo-designed space-ships.Lauded by many and criticized by several for crossing the logics and reasoning too many times, this film reminds us of an inherent ability. To re-quote Gerry Spence, ""I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief."" The choice shall be rested on individual judgments. There is no surprise that this film would have been eventually made by Nolan himself, looking at his history of films like - ""Following"", ""Memento"", and ""Inception"". It won't be an exaggeration to call him a ""wizard"". As with every Christopher Nolan film, the ""possibilities"" are explored and tested in a fashion as if it is not a piece of art, rather a medium of simulation to verify and validate those possibilities, and still a viewer leaves the theater with doubts on conclusion and ends up with a more personalized understanding of the entirety. Even an engineering graduate like me felt his brain in ""over-drive"" post-viewing this two and-a-half-hour long film, where a problem of future human survival was ably defined, described and possibly solved through the Astrophysical hypotheses and theories. Jonathan Nolan proves to be a very resourceful screenwriter to have etched out such a plot and story out of theories based on and suggested by works of Theoretical Physicist, Kip Thorne, who also served as an Executive Producer to the film.The most brilliant works done on the film – VFX (supervised by Paul Franklin; 'The Dark Knight Trilogy') to go par ""make believe"" and actually ""make us believe"" in the possibilities of something that might happen (or might just happen) in distant future; Music, by Hans Zimmer, depicting ominous grandeur and solitude that not only enhanced the vastness of the portrayed outer-space but also, touched the viewer to the core becoming the part of their 'memories'; Sound Design (supervised by Academy Award winner Richard King) and Editing (Lee Smith; ""The Dark Knight"") were an integral part of backbone of the film; and so was its engaging Cinematography (Hyote van Hoytema; ""Her"").Amongst the cast, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathway are indeed brilliant (especially the former) and gently remind their previous Oscar wins. Jessica Chastain, Mckenzie Foy, Michale Caine – play their supporting parts most emphatically. Guest appearances by Casey Affleck and Matt Damon were quite surprising yet, done well.To conclude, the film even with its jargon-heavy second-half doesn't pull down the spirits, and could even be enjoyed for a second time especially by our ""astronomy aficionados"". This film, being helmed as a milestones after works like – ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Avatar"", ""Life of Pi"", ""Gravity"", etc. – is in the most simple words – ""believable; even when it's not"". A 9-rating for its pioneering brilliance and the sheer beauty of the Nolan-style of storytelling.",Interstellar

494,derek-duerden,Better than 2001,7/10,24 July 2020,"About half-way through this I thought ""this is a masterpiece"". The combination of scope, ambition, cinematography, acting and other elements was just compelling.Sadly, for me, somewhere in the second half this feeling went away. I didn't get bored as such, but it lost me (or I lost it) and by the end I felt unsatisfied and a bit disappointed. Possibly more for the unrealised potential rather than anything I can clearly articulate as a criticism.The great thing about Nolan is his level of ambition and with this he certainly succeeded (in my mind) in making a better film than 2001, which for me doesn't even have an ending at all, let alone an unsatisfying one. Normally, I'd say that I'd have to watch this again to really make up my mind... but firstly that would be a serious investment of my time and secondly and more fundamentally, I know I will never recapture that feeling of the first viewing, so I'd rather not try.There are so many great things about this film, though, that I'd unreservedly recommend it to anyone yet to see it.",Interstellar
495,Cinnyaste,A Film Feigning Importance,3/10,10 November 2014,"Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of ""Interstellar"" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. ""Interstellar"" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand ""Inception.""A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special.Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the ""Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service"" trope.Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin?Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in ""Star Trek"" you knew would never make it to the end credits.)An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera.Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed ""Don't Astronauts on ""The Twilight Zone"" Pass Basic Psych Tests?"" plot element.Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes.Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. ""Black Hole"" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.)Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right.There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers.The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie!""Interstellar"" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one.Save very few elements to recommend it, ""Interstellar"" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk.",Interstellar
496,AbhiMathews,"Anything that can happen, will happen",10/10,9 November 2014,"This is sci-fi at its greatest. Entertaining. Thought-provoking. Inspiring.There is a lot to love about Interstellar. Whether it's the breathtaking cinematography or the sentimental moments filled with awe, this is certainly an epoch. Earth is not sustainable—a poignant point clearly expressed throughout the film. With space exploration an upcoming necessity, this movie not only breaks the surface, but delves into the depths of the unknown regarding the ultimate fate of humanity and life in the Universe. Man's survival instinct is one of the strongest driving forces present today, and Interstellar certainly displays the extent of its potential. Time is of the essence, and every second counts when it could be over a year long, literally. From the initial set surrounding a barren Earth quickly crumbling to the ends of space as we know it (or don't), this movie travels through both space and time trying to find a solution. A solution unknown, but a solution nonetheless. Imagination is a skill people seldom use or trivialize more often than not. The opportunity to go above and beyond, to not fear the Universe's infinite possibilities but to rather understand it, is one of mankind's greatest achievements and ongoing goals. Interstellar presents a sharp and worthwhile outlook on the world, and how the Universe works in mysterious, unimaginable ways.",Interstellar
497,airsnob,Such a great film. Nolan is a genius. I want to eat lunch with him.,10/10,31 May 2015,"Only complaint about this movie, is for the first three quarters of the film, we have Mathew as the mumbling, southern lead, and you guessed it ( if you have ever visited the south) you can barely understand what he is saying. Between the mumbling and the accent I had to rewind his speaking parts three, four times to get what he said. It was so bad that sometimes I heard straight gibberish come out of his mouth. If I was lucky, some other actor would repeat his lines. I actually wondered if those were impromptu because the other actor knew no one would comprehend what he just said, and if we didn't, we would miss a very important part. Otherwise, this movie is near perfect. It has everything that you innately want in a film. This movie made me want to brush up on my Physics. Some of the vernacular I wish I could confirm as really making sense. I wondered if I was an Astrophysicist, if the movie would make sense or be accurate. There was one scene in particular I wished I could verify. I was a little sad to learn that Matt made the lead here. There are so many other leading men that I like better ( I think he has lost some of his humanity lately. It often happens to celebrities when they get really famous. They turn into Step-ford Wives , basically. But it's so bad , that it's hard to overcome while watching them on film. You know right after this scene that you are watching they headed to their deluxe trailer and were immensely self consumed for the rest of the day ) but he did a good enough job here that I still enjoyed the movie. This is a great movie . Don't miss it. It will make you feel good, and it's just a really great story. Nolan is amazing. I can't quite grasp the mind on that guy. He is so talented , yet has so much profound thought and just well rounded. It's so unusual to find a writer , that can write with so much diversity. He can write an action movie, a drama, a love story, a villain, a Hero, science , and faith, and all with Oscar worthy depth and feeling. This movie is brilliant and it's comforting to know that not all of us are dumb.",Interstellar
498,ryanwinning1,Interstellar: A thought provoking gem! 10/10,10/10,30 March 2020,"I can't put my finger on why, but I shed tears during this movie at more points than any other movie I've watched. The moral of the story is that life is a process of constantly making decisions. You can make intellectual decisions, decisions out of love, or decisions just for survival. Most of the time when you play it smart and try to do the intelligent thing you'll still miscalculate something and make a mistake. As hard as it is it's always better in the end if you follow your heart, and chase the feeling of love. Decisions for survival is by any means necessary. You can lie or cheat for survival and do whatever you have to do. It's ironic that McCaughnahey doesn't want any of the important people in his life to ever feel like they're alone, yet he's willing to travel deep into space all alone as a sacrifice for others.

499,kevjfarrell,Too long!,6/10,18 March 2015,"I like sci-fi movies that expand your mind and make you think a little more. I found this movie frustratingly slow to get going and keep your interest. I just saw it at a dollar theater and am glad I didn't pay full price when it first came out. The basic concept was interesting. The best of the movie is in the last 45 minutes. I have to admit that I was expecting better - I purposely didn't read the IMDb customer reviews beforehand as I didn't want any spoilers or preconceptions. I really wanted to like this movie more, but sadly I didn't. There were so many parts of the story that were hard to follow and understand at times. Obviously from the ratings I'm in the minority. I would say this is a movie for real sci-fi buffs and enthusiasts. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. But judge for yourself - this is only my opinion.

500,tstudstrup,169 minutes I will never get back,1/10,4 November 2016,"Complete crap!! Christopher Nolan is the most over-rated director in Hollywood!!!I only watched it because I have just seen Matthew Mcconaughey in Dallas Buyers Club where he was fantastic. He was good in this too....But the movie sucks ass and balls!!It is no masterpiece!! Strap in for 2 hours and 49 minutes where nothing happens.""SPOILER AHEAD"" Farmer and some astronauts goes into space to save his kids and the people on earth because our planet is dying and people are starving. Because of hyper-sleep and a black hole and some other nonsense they spend 84 years in another galaxy, looking for a new planet that the human race can populate. They don't age at all because of hyper-sleep and because time is different.Then they find Matt Damon, who was send out there to find a new home for humans. For no reason at all Damon's character is a bad-guy, because maybe Nolan at this point realized something had to happen after 90 minutes of boredom. Damon tries to kill Matthew the farmer and escape in their spaceship but accidentally kills himself. Oh and two of the other good guy astronauts are killed.More boring crap happens and Matthew wakes up at a space-station, now 124 years old, but physically only 40, like when he left. He sees his daughter on her death bed and goes back into the black hole or whatever to find the always annoying Anne Hathaway (the only other surviving astronaut) who found the planet the human race needs to survive.The end.Save yourself the torture and avoid this stinking turd. It makes the boring Inception seem like a good movie.Apart from nice visual effects, some taken directly from Inception, this is Nolans worst movie so far.I just hope Hollywood will wake up and realize Nolan had ONE good movie in him: ""The Dark Knight"" and stop green-lighting his pretentious over-bloated crap.I quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park 1 to sum up this movie: That is one big pile of sh*t!!",Interstellar
501,YJLcool,Nolan's most ambitious sci-fi action drama adventure thriller,8/10,9 November 2014,"These days, few filmmakers dare to reach high enough to challenge our minds and continuously put us on the edge of our seats every time. From the backwards narrative structure of Memento, the illusionary gripping Prestige, the socio-political Dark Knight Trilogy, the dream heist Inception that offers layers of dreaming consciousness, Nolan never ceases to deliver one thought-provoking film after another.This time around, the Nolans (script was written by both brothers) decided take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time by exploring matters of theoretical physics, to inspire us to venture out to the unknown, to reach for the skies. Most importantly, to encourage space exploration, specifically interstellar travel for the survival of our species. Before the release of the film, expectations were high with Interstellar being touted as the most highly anticipated sci-fi film of the year.It should be no surprise that Interstellar offers another mind- challenging movie-going experience for the audience. Despite its long running time, the film is thoroughly engaging with its jaw- dropping, astounding plot twists (especially with its overambitious third act) and foreshadowing that heightens the suspense in the film. Furthermore, Nolan adds more depth to the film's main premise with some thought-provoking matters such as importance of time, personal interests vs global necessity (is it worthy to sacrifice the time with our children when the survival of our species is at risk?) through a simple father-daughter relationship story, watching the characters as they face the reality of a universe that's far bigger than them.The film questions what things in life that really matter to us, to explore and see the world in a larger picture with our limited lifespan. Despite the seriousness and dramatic tension in the film, there are some occasionally funny scenes through the interaction between the human characters and the intelligent yet sarcastic robots, TARS and CASE.Interstellar is as spectacular as Nolan's previous films, by showing us the wonder of space beyond our imagination. Interstellar delivers in terms of spectacle and they're all breathtaking to look at, from Saturn's giant rings, the 4-th dimensional space when a spacecraft enters a wormhole, the exploration of two different planets, the stunning rendition of a spinning black hole and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. All of them are explored in ways that makes me admire the movie very much and I personally respect the director's attempt in showing us these things. Interstellar is considered to be Nolan's most ambitious film to date.However, it seems that Nolan's reach finally exceeds his grasp. Unfortunately, Interstellar isn't as accessible as Nolan's previous movies due to its dense scientific theories. The general audience might find the theoretical physics presented in the film too hard to understand. Its attempt to tackle some of the complicated theoretical physics concepts and philosophical ideas seemed to be rather heavy-handed this time around, especially the film's extremely audacious last act.The film is filled with scientific jargon (space-time dimensions, relativity, time dilation, quantum gravity, gravitational singularity, event horizon, etc) and this could leave certain audience feeling completely underwhelmed. Moreover, the exposition- heavy dialogues feels like characters delivering science lessons to each other. I do understand that exposition is a necessity in science fiction (to spoon-feed the audience with knowledge on science so that we know what's going on) but it's just doesn't feel natural in certain scenes this time around, perhaps this is due to the complexity nature of the scientific concepts presented in the film. Don't get me wrong, the film is great and succeeds intellectually on many levels, but only a handful of audience are capable of understanding it.The film greatest strength lies on its underlying scientific concepts and intriguing plot, but not its characters (with the exception of McConaughey's character). All the enlisted casts are considered to be Hollywood's most talented actors but the film underdevelops the relationships between its characters as science takes a lead role in the story. Despite stellar performances from each of the casts, none of the supporting characters are particularly memorable as their roles aren't well-realised as intended. Many of the characters have very little depth, due to the limited screen time and the need to explain heavy-handed scientific concepts to the audience. Even though Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Sir Michael Caine and Matt Damon each have their own moments, that's just not enough to provide a deep memorable impression to the audience.The heart of Interstellar lies with the bond between the father (Cooper, Matthew McConaughey's character) and his daughter (Murph, Mackenzie Foy's/Jessica Chastain's character) and McConaughey managed to provide a stand-out performance as a strong, likable and relatable yet conflicted lead character: on one hand, he needs to reach for the stars and beyond to save humanity, while the other never wanting to let go of his family. There's a scene in the film where Cooper sheds tears of love and despair while watching 23 years of video messages left by his son back on Earth due to time dilation effect is particularly heartbreaking and would certainly evoke an emotional response from the audience.Overall, Nolan succeeded in taking various complex theoretical physics concepts and use them all together to make a tightly woven story, which is a remarkable feat. Despite its flaws, Interstellar is still an engaging watch and one hell of a journey getting to the end.Rating: 8/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-interstellar.html",Interstellar
502,CelluloidDog,"Muddled yet, well done Sci-Fi",7/10,16 December 2014,"(NOTE: I DON'T CONSIDER THESE SPOILERS BUT SOME MIGHT, NO GIVEAWAYS, JUST DISCUSSION). A paradox. Christopher Nolan is like an Escher drawing or Rubick's Cube. But puzzles don't make great films. They make great puzzles. At 8.9 on IMDb (at this writing), Interstellar has to rank as one of the most overrated films of all time (e.g, The Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club). Overrated doesn't mean bad, BTW. Was it justifiable at $165 million? No. I actually rate this 7.5/10, a thoroughly enjoyable film, one of the year's best 10 films. And maybe among the best 25-30 sicfis of all time. It is actually superior to the critically better- received Gravity. So what's the puzzle this time?ANSWER: Love is the Sixth Dimension. Really, it transcends space, like gravity and time. Even the movie has a couple quotes that suggest it. Love makes the world go round. Preach, Nolan. What's great about the film? Excellent cinematography (9.5), strong acting (9.0, particularly by Michael Caine, Matthew McConaughey, and Jessica Chastain), great directing (9.5, this is actually one of Nolan's best directed films), great editing, great special effects, good soundtrack (not amazing but it certainly fits with the film). I saw Interstellar in an IMAX with butt-kicking seatsso I really did feel like I was taking off in a spaceship or I hit the ground when it crashed. So that clearly added to the fun!I would rank this as one of Nolan's 3-4 best films: The Dark Knight (rate 8.5), Batman Begins (rate 9.0+), Memento (8.0+). Inception (6.5) is vastly overrated. The problem is that Nolan has tapped into what fans like. Puzzles. He found that out with Memento and carried it a bit too far with Inception. So now he has a trademark. The film scored 73% on Rottentomatoes.comwhich is about where I would put it. Maybe it should be 80%-85%?The plot, despite some criticism, was inaccurate but solid fun. However, what hurts the movie (according to those who criticized it):1. Weak writing. The Nolans should have have a scifi writer and physicist join their team. I'll go over a few wormholesI mean, loopholes. 2. Length of the movie. At 168 minutes, it gets redundant. 3. Too much dialogue. 4. Couldn't decide what it wanted to do or say.Issues with writing (plot): 1. The issue of a world dying. Well, it starts off that way talking about failed crops and dust bowls but they don't get worstin the about 25 years time span, we still see crops and no one starving. Nolan needs to rethink how he would draw his future world. Just unconvincing. 2. NASA and farmers. The moon missions were claimed to be a big propaganda. So if they were, how does the government convince people to start traveling into space? That is, government has to convince people to do what they just unconvinced people. That doesn't make sense. Now it really becomes the big lie? The same as how Cooper and his daughter find NASA with coordinates. So if NASA doesn't want to be known, why the big floodlights and ""why are you here?"" Realistically, they would send some local police to escort Cooper off the grounds. A better idea might be allowing Cooper to break in and get caught. Not NASA saying, It's us! How did you find us!"" Rather silly. 3. Building on #2. So NASA realizes they have been caught by a farmer. So you invite the farmer to fly a spaceship? Silly. A more plausible plot is directly approach Cooper to work for NASA again. Or Cooper finding secrets and NASA inquiring hownot a trip and fall into the spaceship routine. 4. Blackhole and travel. So they really are going to explore a planet next to a black hole and dying star? Moving from an Earth that isn't dying to a dying star. Doesn't make sense. Along with that, how do you get transported from a black hole back to Saturn? It wasn't a wormhole. How did he survive in a black hole, how did he communicate? But I think the Nolans were confused themselves. They might have miswrote it and filmgoers just accept and try to explain why. Sometimes writer make mistakes. Like we always see a film with a goof. I don't have too much problem with the scienceor really stretch of science, but if you assume something can happen, than they need to stick with that and not change the rest. So it appears they confused the wormhole and black hole. Some people suggest ""They"" created the portal in the black hole. But we later find out, maybe ""They"" isn't ""They"" so maybe Cooper created it. But how? If he and Murph were the originatorshow did it get there? 5. The first planet and water. Shouldn't TARS be retrieving the data? What's wrong with these people? It doesn't really flow. More like teenagers in a horror movie trying to get killed. Aren't you trying not to get killed? But then, horror movies would lose their victims. 6. Matt Damon. He doesn't make sense. I'm not sure if his character is needed. It was all of a sudden, mad scientist time. 7. Professor Brand's ego. It's stated he knew the solution but didn't want let others know since he wanted space exploration. Really? But he was a part of space-denying NASA? And everyone knew the world was dying? So what's not to say leaving Earth is a good idea? Apparently Brand wasn't convinced a dying planet was a valid reason to leave Earth. Confusing, I know. A flaw in the script. And realistically, a scientist would have reacted the opposite and seek to prove his solution works. But only in the Nolan world of puzzles.",Interstellar
503,radhrh,Am I missing something?,1/10,17 March 2015,"For the life of me I cannot understand how this movie has received an 8.8 rating, nor can I understand Mathew McConaughey, he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick Texas drawl that English sub tittles are required. Not that he has anything interesting to say, nor do any of the other characters for that matter.So, lets have a look at the plot. The World has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers. The only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation. However everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling SUVs, is there something wrong with this picture? In the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet, however a worm hole has been located somewhere near Saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel. Its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared, but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race. So, this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? Much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on Earth etc. and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion I had lost interest....The visual effects aren't all that special, seen it all before. In fact I think the effects in ""2001, ASO"" which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate, were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision.In conclusion then, a plot holier than a month of Sundays, a leading man to whom English is a second language, nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 8.8? I don't think so....",Interstellar
504,moviescoundrel,Stellar for Sure,8/10,7 November 2014,"Grand scale, large score, big visual effects, typical Nolan movie? Um...not so much. This one is really difficult to summarize briefly, and may take multiple viewings to do so. I didn't quite know what to expect based on the previews and I tried not to find too much out about it ahead of time, which ended up to be the right move as many things about this film were surprising. A character drama on HUGE scale and a HUGE screen. IMAX is the place to catch this film in its glory as over an hour of the film was actually filmed with 70 mm IMAX cameras. And those scenes are breathtaking. At a run time of 169 minutes, you get your money's worth of screen time here, and at times it feels like it. This is not ""Inception"" or a ""Batman"" movie. ""Inception"" flew by at 2.5 hours and was suspenseful a majority of the time. This film does not possess that same feel or intensity. There are moments of intensity, and moments of peril and intrigue, but it's also ½ laced with heart, character, time, and soul. As a father who starts down a rather strange path to leave a formidable, cursed earth on an almost certain to fail journey across the galaxy to help save it, Cooper (McConaughey) deals with multiple types of adversity such as: impossible space catastrophes, physical confrontation with people, emotional confrontation with people, internal struggles with helping humanity and sacrificing his possible life and future with and for his daughter. The internal struggles resonated here with me almost more than the physical, visible dangers. Even after a strange ending that went nowhere near I was anticipating, I found myself thinking about the Cooper's sacrifice and choices hours later. I was at first ruling out multiple viewings just based on run time alone, but after reflecting on it a bit, I may have to revisit this in the future.",Interstellar

In my personal opinion, you would have to have a great extensive knowledge on Physics in particular with Space Travel. Like Space-Time Continuum etc., I was lost there. When I saw that Hans Zimmerman was providing the Music Score, I was saying, looks like another Batman movie taking a trip ie seeing it a few times. By golly did it live to its name, ie the Music. The plot was kinda difficult to portray more so my lack of knowledge of the Physical. Earth basically is running out of resources. So Cooper(McCounaghey) along with TARS(Irwin-voice) - the most adorable thing. heeheh, Instantly fell in love with him. hehehehe, Brand(Hathway). Romlliy(Gyasi), Getty(Grace). Cooper leaves behind, Murph(Foy(10yrs), Chastain(), Burtsyn(ODLER)), Tom(Chalamet(15yrs)Affleck()). At the beginning of the film, we see videos. Now I suspect these were the people who either survived or lived trough or whatever the Dust Storm back in the hey day. Cooper heads up on the mission as recruited by Professor Brand(Brand's Daughter(Caine)). He however as we later learn, forgot to mention One titchey weenye thing. And that is, THEY NEVER COME BACK. There're mission or so they understood, was to find a place to get back. While they are on the mission, they encounter Dr. Mann(Damon). Who later reveals to em the truth, and tries to sabotage the plan. The plan was that they start Civilization on the new planet. And to FORGET about Earth. Cooper was given a choise of ""You might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race."". Another thing, I have to mention were the VIEWS. Oh it was heaven.

506,quiqueperezsoler,"Inspirational, heart-wrenching and pioneering. A contemplation of humanity when facing the brink of extinction featuring the hardest decision a father has ever made",9/10,2 April 2020,"This is a completely subjective review:
Where to begin. There's no movie like it and despite the possible scientific inaccuracies and plot holes, the movie shines for many other reasons. The visual effects and the CGI which aren't abused of as they share the spotlight with outstanding practical effects based on models and real-life robots; it's spectacularly jaw-dropping. The execution of the story, the overall ideas and concepts and the final conclusion drives the audience to a mind-blowing perplexion and awe.To see the portrayal of space travelling in such a realistic approach showcasing a how and what it would look like if we had the tools and means to do it is breath-taking and trully inspiring. The movie wanders into realms yet unknown to mankind today so it pulls from fiction and creative imagery to portray things but always stretching the scientific and theoretical basis as long as it can before deciding to make it up. If only the negative critics of this movie would take a closer look at how Christopher Nolan directs his movies they'd see the amount of research and scientists he works with to try to capture whatever he's working on as realistically as possible. He did it for this movie and he also did it for Inception and probably many other of his movies.But the ""interstellar"" space travelling is just a vessel for the real story the movie holds. A story about humanity and the tough decisions we will have to face when and if we face the brink of extinction and the planet can no longer host us as we keep mistreating it. This planet's resources are finite and with anything finite in quantity they're bound to run out eventually. And when that time comes, we will all hope to have the emotional and mindful strength the Coopers and the Brands had in this movie, to look at the others and realise if the fate of humanity lies in our hands, can we really do what's necessary and to do what's right?The movie launches into deep heartwrenching questions and scenarios where we are witness of the best and worse of humanity. And these are only intensified by the tense and scary space travelling slave of time and resources to make the trip possible.As for the story, I'm not yet a father and yet I feel the painful goodbyes and every stressful moment as time passes by and the answers of the movie are not yet found. The performances of everyone are real and evoque authentic reactions to many of the scenarios the characters are put through. You really do end up loving the characters you are meant to but you never really hate the ones you should because their motivations are well developed and understandable. This is really a human story, it isn't space cowboys or Star Wars with heroes meant to save the universe or the planet, these are people willing to risk everything to do it, no superpowers, lightsabers or laser guns.Ever since I first saw the movie I felt a deep connection with it. The movie makes you think, it makes you reflect on us and of what place we occupy in the universe. It makes you stare at the sky, at the stars and wonder what the universe holds beyond what we know. Are there others like us, are there other planets we could some day visit? How far can and will humanity's pioneering potential reach? These questions find a possible answer in the movie without using conventional and well-known ideas and concepts.Another worthy highlight of the movie: the soundtrack. The composer Hans Zimmer is known to be the mastermind behind scores like the Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, the Last Samurai, Gladiator ,etc. Today he's one of the most astounding composers in cinema and proof of that is the score of this movie. Tense and teeth clenching when necessary as well as inspiring and uplifting when the situation requires it. It's unique and holds secrets within I highly recommend you research when you have the time.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a parade of fantastic special effects, music, tense and light situations, contemplative thinking and reasoning, an endearing but heart-wrenching story about humanity and the prospects of facing extinction and what choices and decisions can and should be made. The movie has more bullets in its magazines so unfortunately (or not, depending how you look at it) it requires more than one viewing to fully understand every detail in the plot and also visual cues for you to understand better the ""science"" behind it.Finally, it's true that when you first watch the movie you might end up confused or asking questions. And for those who have never watched a Christopher Nolan movie, this is common with his movies. They are meant to make you think and question what you saw, it's not for the light block-bustery seeking audiences who expected yet another Star Wars. If you take the time to look at what it's trying to say you will be treated with an incredibly well-developed story that may lack in craftmanship or other plot mistakes, but it makes up in a powerful story with well performed characters and an emotional journey. And for the engineers and other scientists like me, you'll probably want to fix the world and build a rocket after watching this movie. It's uplifting and inspiring for those who studied and dream to create and improve society by the use of technology, math and science. And remember ""do not go gentle into that good night"".",Interstellar
507,danajs24,"Good, but over my head",8/10,3 September 2016,"This movie was visually astounding. Every bit the movie it was made out to be with the senses, aesthetically pleasing as well as wonderful sound and music. Murph got a bit annoying throughout the movie, treating Coop very poorly for ATTEMPTING TO SAVE THE WORLD. This is a point that me and my girlfriend disagreed upon, as Coop was trying to Armageddon it up but his daughter was losing it. And apparently she held onto this grudge for 20 years before even talking to him?? What an awful thing to do. And after everything that happens, she's the famous one? She just sat on Earth and did math! He launched himself out of his ship into a black hole! Ridiculous. Matt Damon caught me entirely by surprise, as I had no idea he was in the show. Funny that he loses his mind on a planet by himself, and then in the Martian he keeps his head entirely. Very good movie, a bit of a bummer that they weren't able to win more Oscars. Probably due to the acting, as it was good but not that good.",Interstellar

510,vandelour,"Not good, not bad",5/10,19 November 2014,"First, the fun stuff. Its too long. By a good 30-40 minutes. Second, the sound is god-awful. As in *intentionally* god-awful according to Chris Nolan. Third, its just sort of an iffy story with an iffy ending. Now, the drudge work. MM does a good job as the lead and the supporting cast is also good. Not great, not award winning but competent and professional. The home world part of the story is not given enough of a boost and the interstellar part is given too much -- but then, Interstellar is the title and not Home World so they had to fluff up the title stuff. I kind of preferred the Home World storyline over the Interstellar as I thought it had more dramatic potential while avoiding the whole how-are-we-gonna-end-this-thing problem. No spoilers here and no long-winded stuff either. Its OK, go see it if you want to risk blood clots in your legs from sitting too long.

OK...well, it turns out that NASA has been sending people into space for quiet a while and an ex-NASA pilot has stumbled into a secret NASA ""war room"" - or was he ""called"", like the guy from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS THIRD KIND? (this dude in his 40s got an early retirement because of the ongoing bad economy - seems his extraordinary skills were not even marketable!).some have actually settled on planets in another galaxy (see, an unnamed ""helper"" has carved out a piece of the sky just beyond SAturn, which is really a catapult to deep space, where habitable spheres exist).if these presumptive aliens know about our agriculture problem, why don't they just send a few saucers down to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, and leave them a disk with all the instructions on how to turn it all around? > Space is great, but why not make it simple? very interesting Science is also presented, though > our Hero must deal with the reality that when he returns to Earth, his Daughter is 42 and so is he. he finds other more serious challenges, however, while en route...and this kind of stuff is pupil dilating. will his exploration create any detours to throw his ""schedule"" off course? Michael caine, Ellen Burstyn, and JOhn Lithgrow are the only actors I recognize..oh yeah..the quiet dude from the Lincoln commercials. He is as expressive in this 2 .5 hr. epic as he is staring straight ahead, in a more mundane form of transportation. The only bad acting job here is by the star. When he finally cracks a smile, the Gentleman Quarterly stud looks like Soupy Sales. (not a bad thing). All the rest of the cast is just fine. I hope their checks cleared.",Interstellar
512,indiedavid,Don't believe the hype,6/10,7 November 2014,"""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.

Using the theories of interstellar travel, the visual wonders created from these theories are stunning. The structure is still Nolan's usual parallel montage acceleration, and the final reversal is a loop.Very traditional Hollywood genre writing, but the use of detail and foibles is absolutely textbook, and the core of the story is always love, making people cry.

515,Mike_Yike,"Nope, Not Quite",5/10,17 February 2015,"I saw this movie at a 2nd run theater so I'm a little behind, but my review is still valid, just late. The best thing about the movie were the special effects. They were really good. The trouble is; these days most special effects are really good. At the risk of dating myself, there isn't much Claymation out there anymore. Right near the beginning, the main character, Cooper, happens along the NASA launch site hidden near his farm. It just so happens that Cooper is the perfect pilot for the space adventure. I mean; what are the odds? The movie features a lot of time travel, black holes etc. There is a part near the end where Cooper is stuck in some kind of time warp or another dimension, and while in his spacesuit he is caught in an odd limbo behind his daughter's book shelf. I'd explain it to you with greater understanding, but I do not have a greater understanding.The film was a little bit of 2001; A Space Odyssey, a dash of Gravity, and a little bit of Apollo 13. One surprise was the obligatory talking robot never turned evil.I was about equal parts entertained, and annoyed by the movie, which does not make it worth recommending.",Interstellar
516,muons,The most overrated movie of the year if not years to come...,3/10,25 December 2014,"The movie starts very slowly. There's hardly anything interesting in the first hour. During that time, I almost fell asleep in the theatre. Despite the commendable efforts to make it comply with the predictions of modern physics like time dilation, twin paradox, etc. the plot is still full of gaps and utterly nonsensical actions which defy your logic. The ""scientific"" references to quantum mechanics, general relativity and string theory (this one is rather implicit...) in the dialogues are very pretentious and most of the time plain silly. The only parts of the movie that would evoke interest and probably keep you awake are as usual about human drama, power struggle and emotional encounters. In this regard, all the efforts to make it compatible with the laws of modern physics become useless and a waste of time. Indeed, I have yet to see any movie that can pull it off since ""Contact."" In this regard, I'd rather see ""dumb"" sci-fi movies which concentrate on drama like the first and 2nd gen Star-Trek than this sort of half-ass physics-wanna-be stuff which fail to address your imagination.On the positive side the plot is clear, unobstructed and easily understandable despite the references to theoretical physics. Compared to sheer crap like ""Cloud Atlas"" that certainly deserves a praise hence my three stars for the rating.",Interstellar

Written as a love letter to his daughter, Nolan's latest sci-fi epic isn't quite as depressing as his usual films, but it's not as monumentally mesmerizing as we have come to expect from the man who brought us ""Dark Knight"" and ""Inception."".The story is a little cheesy, with mushy questions about love being able to cross time and such, and there are moments that the special effects reminded me of ""Clash of the Titans."" No, not the remake...the 1981 original. I found that quite shocking and sorta dismaying...and confusing. As confusing as it was at times trying to wrap my brain around the concepts of relative time and black holes and dimensions.However, the film is ultimately still entertaining, made me verklempt at moments and has a really nice message about the future of our planet being in our own hands and no one else, not even whatever god you might believe in, is going to save us if we don't save ourselves.",Interstellar
518,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, cause our destiny lies above us.""",8/10,9 January 2015,"In the not-too-distant future of Interstellar, Earth has been ravaged by an environmental disaster known as the Blight – forcing humanity to abandon technology and the dreams of discovery, in order to focus on basic survival. To that end, former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widowed father of two, is now a farmer tasked with growing one of the planet's last remaining sustainable crops: corn. In a time when humankind has been asked to put aside personal desire in the interest of a greater good, Cooper has attempted to make peace with farm life, providing for his teenage children, Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy), as well as his aging father-in-law (John Lithgow). Yet, even as conditions become increasingly dire on Earth, Cooper's thirst for scientific discovery remains.However, when Cooper is reunited with an old colleague, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), he is offered a new chance to fulfill an old ambition. Informed that the situation on Earth is much more serious than he previously knew, Cooper is asked to leave his family behind (in an increasingly dangerous world) and set out on an uncertain journey into space – to find humankind a new planet.Director Christopher Nolan has built a career on cerebral storytelling – starting with his feature debut, Following, in 1998. Since that time, the filmmaker has delivered one thought-provoking drama after another (Insomnia, Memento, The Prestige, and Inception) – while also setting a new bar for comic book adaptations with a contemplative three-film exploration of Batman (and his iconic villains). As a result, it should come as no surprise that Nolan's Interstellar offers another brainy (and visually arresting) movie-going experience – one that will, very likely, appeal to his base (those who spent hours pouring over minute details in the director's prior works); however, it may not deliver the same casual appeal that made Inception and The Dark Knight cross- demographic hits.Interstellar is an imaginative movie, but a heavy-handed mix of personal sacrifice and theoretical physics doesn't leave much room for subtle storytelling (or particularly memorable action). For a film that is rooted in the love between a father and his daughter, Interstellar offers surprisingly cold (and often stiff) drama – albeit drama that is buoyed by high-minded science fiction scenarios and arresting visuals. Nolan relies heavily on lengthy scenes of surface-level exposition, where characters debate or outright explain complicated physics and philosophical ideas, to educate the audience and ruminate on humanity (both good and bad) in the face of death and destruction.Unlike Nolan's earlier works, the filmmaker's passion is most apparent in his science (based on the theories of physicist Kip Thorne) - rather than his characters. This isn't to say that Interstellar doesn't provide worthwhile drama, but there's a stark contrast between the lofty space-time theories and the often melodramatic characters that populate the story.McConaughey ensures his lead character is likable as well as relatable, and manages to keep exposition-heavy scenes engaging. Still, despite a 169 minute runtime, Interstellar never really develops its central heroes beyond anything but static outlines – and Cooper is no exception. Viewers will root for him, and come to understand what he cherishes and believes about humanity, but any major revelations come from what happens to him – not necessarily what he brings to the table or how he evolves through his experiences.The same can be said with regard to the supporting cast. Everyone involved provides a quality turn in their respective roles, but they're shackled by straightforward arcs – limited exposition machines that add to the film's thematic commentary and/or advance the plot, but aren't particularly well-realized or as impactful as Nolan intends. To that end, in a cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon, two of the most memorable characters are actually non-humans - quadrilateral-shaped robots, TARS and CASE, that aid the crew on their adventure (and inject much-needed humor into the proceedings).Casual film-goers who were wowed by the director's recent filmography may find that Interstellar isn't as accessible as Nolan's prior blockbuster movies – and dedicates too much time unpacking dense scientific theories. Nevertheless, while the movie might not deliver as much action and humor as a typical Hollywood space adventure, the filmmaker succeeds in once again producing a thought-provoking piece of science fiction. For fans who genuinely enjoy cerebral films that require some interpretation, Interstellar should offer a satisfying next installment in Nolan's well-respected career.That said, for viewers who are simply looking to get lost in a thrilling adventure with memorable characters (from the director of Inception and The Dark Knight), Interstellar may not provide enough traditional entertainment value to balance out its brainy scientific theorizing. On many levels, it's a very good film, but Interstellar could leave certain moviegoers underwhelmed – and feeling as though they are three-dimensional beings grasping for straws in a five-dimensional movie experience.",Interstellar
519,nmholland,"Not Nolan's Best, But Still A Very Enjoyable Film",9/10,21 February 2016,"Interstellar is directed by the one and only Christopher Nolan, and stars Matthew Mcconaughey as Cooper, an ex-pilot in a futuristic Earth, where another Dust Bowl has taken place, and Earth is no longer a suitable home for the human race. One day, Cooper and his daughter Murphy (Murph, for short) stumble upon NASA's base, who was long thought gone, and Cooper is recruited to lead a team through a wormhole next to Saturn, so that humans could colonize a different planet, and live on. Oh, and Anne Hathaway is in there, too.To start, the movie's directed by Nolan, so of course it's beautifully directed, and is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen, in terms of cinematography. All of the full screen shots of different planets, and black holes, and such look completely amazing. The score is also great (thanks Hans Zimmer). Every time anything was happening, the pounding score just sucked you right into the situation.The acting was also top notch. Matthew Mcconaughey does great as Cooper, and you really feel for him having to leave his family, particularly his daughter Murph, and the emotional impact that has on him. Anne Hathaway does great as well, although she has a pretty shallow character. Jessica Chastain does great as Murph, also portraying the emotional connection between Murph and Cooper. The whole cast do well in their roles. However, this leads into the first big negative.The characters are very washed out, and lead to a script that's too long. Casey Affleck plays Cooper's son, and his character is completely unnecessary. This character even causes a sub plot towards the end of the film, that probably adds 10 to 15 minutes to the run time. Another tacked on character would be Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon. He obviously symbolizes mankind, and adds around 25 minutes to the film with his subplot. Overall, this movie is near three hours, mostly due to all of these subplots.Another predictable and tacked on thing is a plot twist that occurs toward the end, dealing with Murph's ""ghost."" There really wasn't much need for this, and it felt very unnecessary.Now, in conclusion, is this Nolan's best film? No. Definitely not. However, I'm not saying it's bad. It really is quite good, in all reality. I'm going to give Interstellar an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",Interstellar

The background music made by Hans Zimmer 
The great visual effects 
Special cast 
And many more...
The script is very well written thanks to Jonathan Nolan . The development of the relationship between a father and his daughter makes the film even more intersting . It's full of suspense and mysteries Christopher Nolan proved himself once more and Interstellar is an achievement that marked the sci-fi movies categories

521,joncha,Lots of (non-black) holes in the plot,6/10,23 August 2020,"""The Time Machine"" meets ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's difficult for most people to comprehend the concept of a Black Hole and differences in time passage affected by space travel. While those elements are central to this movie's plot, the story also focuses on a man's relation to his family and a dying planet (Earth) where people try to pursue their normal lives despite Dust Bowl conditions and a dwindling supply of food (to incurable diseases which have wiped out wheat and other food crops) and availability of breathable air. Add to this the story element that the best space jockey in the world quit NASA (because of some questionable flying decisions) to become a farmer like his ancestors. Then he stumbles upon a secret government facility which is preparing to send a ship through a Black Hole to find three earlier probes which went to three different planets that might prove to be suitable for resettlement for dwellers of a dying Earth. He is immediately put in command of this mission although he didn't even know about it until yesterday, basically because of his fame as a great pilot. The plot gets even more involved as he and his top research companion and the oddest robot ever to appear in movies attempt to visit the three planets and determine which, if any, is suitable for earthlings. The rest of the story is too difficult to explain, let alone comprehend. Just remember that quantum physics, Black Holes, time travel and the lot, like theology, are sometimes incomprehensible for many, if not most people, but it you sit back and aren't too critical about obvious non-black holes in the plot, it's an enjoyable, if longish, movie to watch.",Interstellar

523,DunkelheitVZ,thanks for mixing Science with Fiction,10/10,3 April 2015,"I have read a lot of reviews about this movie. Yes, there are plot holes, but think about all the other movies we get these days and you cannot possibly say that this wasn't a huge, huge step forward.There are not many SF films any more, these days they are action packed movies in a futuristic environment. What made SF for me when I was young was the stretching of my mind, the endless possibilities and last but not least the feeling of how awesome it would be if it would really happen.And when they launched the spaceship, when the main character was talking about exploration, I felt like a kid again.If you compare this movie with reality as we perceive it now, if you look eagerly for every little plot hole to point out that the movie is not as accurate as it seems to proclaim, yes, it will fail for you. At the same time you watch the horrendous depiction of physics in movies like Fast & Furious 29 and feel entertained.I for myself decided to be a bit more forgiving. The masses seem not to be ready for highly complex SF films. A ""dumb"" character is needed these days in all flicks to explain even the most simple twists. The overwhelming majority is more interested in Superstars than in Physics. And in these times I am more than grateful for a movie like this.It was not only entertaining, it was thought provoking and it was beautifully photographed. The movie could have been way worse and I still would rate it 10 stars.Thank you very much for this movie and please make more films like this.",Interstellar

So many scenes could have been cut.The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit.",Interstellar

Blind, so I wouldn't have to see it, and deaf so that I wouldn't have to hear the soundtrack, which was like having nails pounded into your skull with a hammer. I will now have to plug my headphones into my iPhone and play a few Motley Crue songs just to get the sludge out of my brain. This gets 2 out of 10 only because some of the acting (and overacting) was good, so the actors get some credit here. Lots of boo-hooey scenes of astronauts crying over this and that, the soundtrack being relentlessly over-dramatic and so was everything else. This is the sort of film where you could take all the characters and blow them up with an atom bomb, and you would find yourself cheering at the end. Honestly, two hours of Beavis and Butt-Head reruns would be a vast improvement over this movie.

527,aaronjbong,"""Do not go gentle into that good night""",9/10,9 November 2014,"Space is an interesting setting, due to its enigmatic properties, hidden secrets, and just the sense of awe it instills on us. There's something alluring to space, whether it's because of our curiosity to explore what's out there, or just because of the seemingly endless void of darkness. It's fascinating, and yet terror-inducing.In ""Interstellar"", the earth has been ravaged by blight, and is in a desolate condition. Farming is the number one occupation and the only crops that still survive under the harsh conditions (frequent dust storms) is corn. Our protagonist is Cooper, a widowed engineer and former pilot who has two children, Tom and Murph. After an accidental incident, he stumbles onto a NASA hideout. There, he meets Professor Brand who informs him of the existence of a wormhole (a phenomenon that theoretically is able to act as a ""shortcut"" through spacetime). Then, he is requested by Brand to pilot the Endurance, an experimental spacecraft joined by Amelia (Brand's daughter), Doyle and Rommily, along with two versatile robots named CASE and TARS, on a trip to the discovered wormhole in hopes of colonizing new worlds to ensure mankind's survival. But this is a Christopher Nolan film, so there is sure to be more layers surrounding the plot of the film. ""Interstellar"" boasts some of the most exhilarating and beautiful images I have ever seen on the big screen, and as i watched these spatial phenomenons unfold, I was completely baffled. I may not know much about astrophysics, but the wormhole and the spinning blackhole were extremely grand, massive, and digital wonders. Comparisons to ""Gravity"" will surely be present, but ""Interstellar"" is different enough in the sense that it has a much larger scale of setting and story then ""Gravity"". One of the highlights this film carries is its scientific accuracy. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne served as the scientific consultant of this film and the movie had a lot of physical concepts, most of which were interesting, but sometimes quite hard to grasp quickly. The quite prominent concept is that of time dilation, a phenomenon that occurs due to the difference in gravitational potential. Time will pass slower when there is a higher gravitational potential. In one situation, the characters visit a planet that is in close proximity to a blackhole, which means for every one hour they're there seven hours have elapsed back on Earth. Time is a valuable resource and therefore, everything the characters do must be carefully considered. There are other concepts too such as gravity and the nature of time itself. Running at nearly three hours long, the film runs quite slowly in the first act, sweeps up into full gear in the second (after we enter the wormhole), but ends with a quite abrupt, rushed and confusing third act. Perhaps the concept makes sense but it feels quite out of place and preposterous. Nonetheless, the film is one that will make you think, one that actually requires you to think, and one that utilizes its characters to exchange ethical ideas. Director Christopher Nolan's confident sense of direction allows this movie to successfully hit the right notes as the film progresses. The film has a lot of big talent in its cast and Matthew McConaughey leads the pack as Cooper. Fresh off his Academy Award-winning performance from ""Dallas Buyers Club"", McConaughey delivers a sensational experience as a caring father who is torn between having to travel far to save the world or be with his children. Anne Hathaway is superb as Amelia Brand, a very determined astronaut who later gets caught in her own motives and becomes confused in her judgment of what's right and wrong. Jessica Chastain was also amazing, able to display her anger and frustration at her father for leaving, and also her newfound determination to do something herself to help the human race. The rest of the supporting cast couldn't be anymore better. And don't forget about the two robots TARS and CASE, very imaginative creations who provide the light-hearted humor amidst the brooding atmosphere of the film.In conclusion, ""Interstellar"" is a very beautiful visual experience that will take you back to that moment when you see something that made you feel out of this world, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It is however a long epic film filled with technical concepts of physics and therefore, quite a heavy film for your mind to work on. But with the help of a superb cast and a clear direction from Christopher Nolan, ""Interstellar"" is a ride you should not miss, and instead experience on the big screen in its entirety.",Interstellar
528,sujanfaster,A 166 minute journey that takes you through years,10/10,7 November 2014,"After completing an epic superhero saga (The Dark Knight trilogy), Nolan comes back to test your brains as he has done several times in the past. Interstellar is more than just a film. It's a journey. It's a journey in which you travel and experiment through different dimensions of space along with the lead characters (please watch it in IMAX). It is evident that one would compare this with Gravity, but apart from some special effects, nothing is similar to Gravity. It's a complete new way of storytelling through space travel. The movie has all the elements. Visual effects are the best part. I know it's a common thing in recent big budget movies and everyone does it well. But Interstellar not only gets it right but also unique. You will experience a unique space travel compared to other movies. And also you need to think hard while watching this movie as listening to most of the dialogues is like sitting in an astro- physics class. But you cannot complain when the visuals are so engrossing. Even though if it's tough to understand sometimes, the visual effects makes your ticket price worth. I am also overwhelmed by the fact that the movie is in 2D, as it shows how well you can make a movie with the same visual effects without having the 3D. I hope this movie gets the Hollywood back to its golden 2D age.Ten years ago, you could have never expected Mathew McConaughey to pull of a role like this. The way he shifts from one emotion to another is just spell bounding. Anne hathway does justice to her role, though she looks a little pale. Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine have some important roles as well. The movie doesn't depend much on its supporting characters, but Nolan extracts the best out of everyone.I expected a brainer from Nolan and Interstellar is one. But its not how you think it will be. This goes to some levels that even your imaginations can't reach.",Interstellar
529,spiritof67,One For The Ages - And The Genre,9/10,12 March 2015,"First, a disclaimer: a lot of people here think they've seen a lot of movies, or at least a lot of science fiction movies. I've seen more, a lot more than most, starting in 1955. And this one ranks up there with the very, very best. Story. Acting performances, some from actors thought impossible to deliver same. Special effects that did a 1950's job of USING 3D, even though this movie isn't 3D, it is shot so well and with so much depth you'd think it was. Ideas....the thing missing from so many modern movies. Direction. And a strong ending, so often missing from modern science fiction films usually out to set up a sequel.It is the finest science fiction movie I've seen since Dark City, and that says a lot.I saw Dark City 5 times on screen and saw new things in it each time. I hope to be able to re-enjoy Interstellar again, hopefully on an even larger screen - if there actually is a screen big enough for this movie.",Interstellar
530,Beachbum2018,Just doesn't work as classic sci-fi sorry,8/10,22 January 2021,"Watched this several times now but I just can't love it or get it beyond an 8, no matter what I do.
It's a great plot, but it fails in execution and sone planning!The problems they encounter in space are not tacked logically never mind scientifically , like...
Why explore planets so close to a black hole, it's stupid there's no future in it (excuse the pun).Why explore Mann's planet and why does Dr Brand has an emotional connection with one of the explorers.The black hole communication with Cooper's past is iffy at best, but as we don't know any better technically it's liveableThey never brought anywhere near enough fuel for what could be the most important mission in historyThe big problems are two really badly cast roles...
Anne Hathaway's Dr Brand character is just annoying, stupid, and arrogant, but Hathaway is miscast in the role for me.The elder Dr Brand character played by Michael Caine is also miscast for me.Both are excellent actors don't get me wrong, just not in these roles. There was no empathy, no feeling or sympathy generated between viewer and character, I really could care less if both characters fell under a combine harvester!... then the next issues are technical like the TARS robot, it's just not credible, a big shiny metal box with pivoting legs and whacky programming.... just doesn't feel right, and doesn't help sell the movie!.. and the cheap along the fuselage shots of the spacecraft, couldn't they afford decent CGI with this budget.... and why the hell are they submerged in water for the hibernation units!.... and finally it's just too bleak throughput, it needed to be much more positive, instead it constantly feels like they're going to fail, and you quickly end up wanting them to!So all in all, a good sci-fi movie, just not a classic one!",Interstellar
531,chuck-526,definitely see this one,8/10,9 November 2014,"Likely judgment by history will see it as a ""near miss"" rather than a ""masterpiece"" ...but so what: easily one of the best movies of this current season.The physicist was actually involved in the project _before_ any of the movie people. So you needn't worry about accuracy. Some of the physics though is quite speculative - for example who knows what the edge of a black hole's event horizon really looks like. There are no obvious whoppers (although if you think hard enough about it later, there are just a few things that don't quite seem to add up).To humanize the story -so it's not just a physics lesson- there are themes of i) romantic love, ii) parent<->child love, and iii) humanity always actively pushing the boundaries rather than ever passively accepting anything. None of the themes are presented in an overwhelming way -this is not a ""message movie""- ...but they're definitely there.I saw lots of similarities to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": unseen superbeings, scenes that make little sense on the first viewing, scenes that are downright mystical, and bits of special effects that are as much ""light show"" as ""movie"".There are a lot of different things crammed into one movie: a positive description may be something like ""sprawling"", and a negative description of the same thing may be something like ""undigestible mass"".The director is very interested in picture quality, and has arranged a bewildering array of distribution formats so every theater can show it in whatever way is best for itself. There are so many different formats, advertising of particular formats is rare (probably because theaters are afraid of all the confusion), and so it's not always easy to find out which format a particular theater is showing. My recommendations are either the ""real IMAX"" format or the ""4K digital"" format. ""Real IMAX"" uses the old giant film, and is most likely found in the older IMAX theaters often attached to some sort of Museum of Science (_not_ the same as the ""IMAX-lite"" found in many multiplexes). The ""4K digital"" format is common either in theaters that were converted to digital only in the big push a couple years ago, or in theaters that have enough money to constantly upgrade their projection equipment. Most likely theaters capable of showing the ""4K digital"" format have either been displaying ""4K digital"" on their splash screen before every movie for months, or have a plaque that says ""4K digital"" on the wall by the theater entrance. And no question, if the theater can play it, they will almost certainly have it. (""IMAX-lite"" theaters may put on a really good show too - I simply don't know.) There's quite a bit of explication, some on the more esoteric aspects of the physics and some to set up plot points. However the explication is notably brief. In fact sometimes a single sentence will appear to be just a throw-away for atmosphere, but will turn out to explain a scene that happens an hour or two later.Be prepared to settle in, as this film is almost three hours long. That allows it to have lots of little climaxes, rather than the typical movie structure of just a couple big ones. Sometimes I was glued to the screen for tens of minutes, while other times a bathroom break seemed like a good idea. And it kept flipping back and forth. The freedom from a rigid typical structure also means the film has a separate ending for each subplot, rather than trying to tie up all the loose ends all at once.For some people when it's over it's over. But many will find it flickering back to life in their thoughts hours later.The special effects use CGI only occasionally (but spectacularly); many of the special effects were done some other way. There were lots of unusual camera setups, special photography, sets, and models (informally called ""maxatures"" rather than ""miniatures"" because they were so big - for example the space station model was 23 feet across). Having seen plenty of real NASA footage on TV in my youth, it was too easy for me to write off the weightlessness and space travel effects as ""of course it looks like that"". In fact the effects are astounding - for example I've never seen a realistic portrayal before of space travelers transitioning from weightlessness to standing as the circular space station spins up.You won't see it in any credits or any advertising, but one of the characters is played by Matt Damon. This is described as a ""cameo"", which I find rather silly; the part involves more complex characterization and more screen time than some of the credited characters, which is not my conception of a ""cameo"". Fortunately it only matters to movie freaks anyway.",Interstellar
532,MovieSonic,Must watch,9/10,16 March 2015,"I watched Interstellar after completing my third re-watch of the Farscape series. As soon as talk of wormholes kicked in, I couldn't help but think of John Crichton and I felt sorry for all other Sci Fi films and TV series once Interstellar explained that they'd been depicting wormholes incorrectly all this time! In fairness, wormholes are only theoretical so I say each to their own interpretation.The film is extremely long. I actually don't mind when an excellent film is very long but I do mind when I spot lots of scenes that could easily have been edited down. One example being: do we need to watch someone climb all the way down a flight of stairs? Especially when they have no more dialogue? I would have expected more characters to have time to be developed but despite the nearly three-hour run time, I have no understanding for why Cooper's son turned out the way he did and there was barely any backstory for the majority of the main characters.Having said that, there was plenty of time to fully explore the Sci Fi aspects of the film which is what we're all really here for. I remember thinking that Interstellar is what Contact (1997) should have been as opposed to the massive anti-climax that it was. In fact, it's what Gravity (2013) should have been what with all the fuss over it. Contact was a great film but a bit before its time I'm guessing, whereas Gravity felt more like a test run before releasing Interstellar. I'm sure it wasn't, it's just that Gravity was such a bad film; nothing happened! The storyline had been done a thousand times before, only this time it was set in space. And that appalling ending!Interstellar gets so many things right. It doesn't shy away from the meaty Sci Fi stuff that people like me want to see. We actually get to see the wormhole, black hole, dimensions and planets. There's an intense atmosphere generated throughout the entire film and I was constantly in full hyper-alert mode for extended periods of time. I loved the backstory of why people on Earth were suffering because they kept it simple and believable. Occasionally, a ridiculous plot twist or explanation would trigger my 'as if' reflex but later, it would be explained so that it was no longer daft, for example; they would make an assumption which would later prove to have been wrong however, although this provides immediate relief for the part of you that's still screaming 'what?!' at the screen, it doesn't change the fact that you just spent half an hour or so silently seething about the stupidity of the plot.I enjoyed so much of this film but I do have to take a moment to acknowledge the poor casting. It's a pure Hollywood vehicle of course and one of only a handful of genuinely incredible films that have been released in the past few years so of course everyone and their best pal is going to want a piece of it. They slowly introduce new characters so it's never too much of a shock to the system when a familiar face appears but one or two were just badly miscast. Matt Damon for example, has this weird thing where at first, he is Matt Damon; same look, same voice and same mannerisms, but then something will happen and he'll end up acting everyone off the screen with his ability to make you empathise even when you shouldn't. His role here is no different. My reaction to his appearance started out as 'well, this film's ruined' and ended with 'only he could have pulled that off'.It has to be said: Matthew McConaughey needs to calm down. There are some signature mannerisms that he's taken to and it all comes across as quite egotistical. I think he accomplished something in his career that few ever have or could but I reckon a lot of his success was down to his humility and great personality which translated to people wanting to help him but the more aloof and serious he acts (literally), the more this puts me off him as an actor. No disrespect intended, but McConaughey has never changed his accent (as far as I'm aware), has never done any character acting and has essentially been playing the same character in every film for years. It seems that he's worked out that talking really slowly and keeping a serious scowl on his face for two to three hours, makes people take his performance more seriously and mistake that for 'great acting'. I would rather he went back to having an approachable demeanour and worked on his ability to transform himself than take the lazy route of just being super serious all the time. It gets old. Also, the fake tan was out of control and actually quite distracting.Once you've watched Interstellar, you'll be Googling things like ""gravitational time dilation"" and wondering when you will next have a spare three hours to watch the film again. Flaws and all.9/10",Interstellar
533,Jim-Eadon,"Detached drivel, just about watchable",4/10,10 September 2015,"This awkward movie felt like Sci Fi produced by a technical, corporate entity. The idea was fairly cute. Much depended on the mourning by the daughter, but the actress didn't make me care about her. The protagonist didn't make me care about him either, for that matter. I thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting, her choices, angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie. The Black Hole stuff was horrible, but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story. He was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch, What the...? Nothing in this movie made sense. Every major scene was blatantly impossible. Worst of all, there was no warmth, no compassion, no style, no love.

Cooper did not embrace ""my journey is the stars and the sea"" lingyun ambition, just want to finish the task as soon as possible back to her daughter to accompany her growth. In the fall of the human crisis, Murphy's ultimate haven is still the place where he and his father have the most memories.

538,badoli,This is a masterpiece.,10/10,8 November 2014,"I watched the movie yesterday at my local IMAX-theater and i'm still in shock on how much this movie impressed me. Never was i glued to a chair for almost three hours straight as much as here.The film does just so many things exceptionally well, that it's hard to find words for it. The atmosphere is so tense and immersive, i couldn't lend myself to question anything within this amazingly designed world. The scenario of a dystopian doomed earth is told in a remarkable subtle way. Never do you see apocalyptic catastrophes as in ""2012"", yet you can almost feel this world crumbling to literally dust before your eyes and the pain of the people who know their fate was creepingly sealed while they continue their now almost senseless worldly duties of farming and watching baseball games.Within such a ingenious set environment any actor could perform remarkably, but the cast does just magnificent, proving their shared 5 academy awards all again. I felt torn apart between all those amazingly believable characters, their motivations and their motives. People who desperately cling to whatever they have left in a ghost of what once was our world. People who take leaps of faith jumping into unknown missions heading for unchartered territories to save whatever they hold dear. People witnessing events incomprehensible to human minds have to deal with unthinkable decisions that push them to the edge of what it means to be human. A gigantic acting task. And yet the cast seems to do it with astonishing ease.The screenplay doesn't mess around either. So much information is packed tight, the movie could have been three times the length and still make a remarkable tense movie. Hence the story at times appears a bit convoluted, but it keeps its edge. And despite the huge amount of emotional topics being touched on, not once does it fall into any of the usual kitschy Hollywood-clichés and -tropes. Instead it keeps a refreshingly sober, at times almost scientific and documentary tone, which gives so much credence to this world.So yes, this is simply a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan blew away any reservations in my mind that Hollywood is still able to impress me deeply. This movie instantly went to my top 3 movies of all times.",Interstellar

This film has a great story line with all the fun theoretical physics you find in good Sci-fi movies. I just can't say enough about this one, it's a must watch!

Did they need the cliché of the 'crazy character who wants to destroy the whole thing at 3/4 of the movie'?The after ending where the main character flies (HOW???) to reach his Eve to restart human race on another planet in another galaxy.Too long prologue: even Kubrick odyssey has a shorter one!2. too love.OK, gravitational fields can travel through time and space, but love??? This is not even wrong: is meaningless, at least in a Sci-Fi movie. What should we expect after this? The Hand of God which saves His beloved Earth?3. too fragmentedI hated the editing of scenes on Earth and on another galaxy in sequence.

543,verna-a,An expensive mess,5/10,15 November 2014,"There are some great moments in this film but fatal flaws in the story and script. It does succeed in building suspense and providing a visual ""wow"" factor, but only after it has lost viewer conviction by a lot of silliness and implausibility. I went to see it as I do many sci-fi films hoping to have a similar experience to that provided by 2001 : a Space Odyssey in the 1960s. Alas recent attempts all fall short by comparison, by succumbing to the temptation to include a lot of cheap tricks. Instead of relying on the scenario, story and setting to provide the engagement factor, American directors can't resist introducing the macho hero, the improbable baddie and schmaltzy sentimentality. Oh for a bit of discipline! The first part of the film is frankly painful. Matthew McConaughey drawls and postures and has a vapid open-mouthed expression most of the time. It's pretty much impossible to understand what he is saying. The situation on Earth is difficult to understand and doesn't achieve any credibility. The science seems to be gobbledy-gook, which holds for the entire film. Interest improves when they get out into space and some of the situations create considerable tension, enabling the viewer to sit out the film with a better grace. Towards the end the story disintegrates into incomprehensible nonsense. A lot of the sentimental basis of the film rests on Cooper's relationship with his daughter, so it's a significant flaw that the 3 actresses who play her do not resemble each other facially (obviously a problem, but not handled well). Matt Damon can't do much with his admittedly silly part, and doesn't look too interested. Altogether, what a waste of resources. This film needed a guiding genius, as I am assuming the weaknesses reflect ""too many cooks"". However a really good story followed fairly closely (as was the case in 2001) would have been a good start. The story is one of the weakest elements here and it shows.",Interstellar
544,lale-ba,Deja vu,4/10,12 November 2014,"For God's sake people, cut with your praises. Anyone who has read or seen any of the Space odyssey books/films will be bored to death watching this cheap and hollow ripoff of the story about space and time travel, alien intelligence and human/robot interfacing. The theme itself is fascinating, but the story and character development simply doesn't exist. Cuts are done with a chainsaw, story is full of holes and the twist at the end isn't as nearly dramatic as in previous Nolan's flicks. Cast is really, really terrible, lead by the Matt Daaaaaamon. Design is truly non innovative, production of the space movie looks really cheap and Zimmer's music is totally offbeat. There are some good things as well, like the scene with the video messages, or the ending design of the library scene. However, two scenes is really not nearly enough for a such hugely anticipated movie that comes from such an outstanding director. Although I consider myself a big CN fan, I must sadly admit that the Hollywood has ran him over and that his career is in a steep decline following Inception.

545,Tyson14,an epic masterpiece,10/10,12 November 2014,"The much-anticipated Interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions, both on film and in the film's response. Many, like myself, found it to be an unprecedented masterpiece. Others have called the film too outlandish or ridiculous, due to its fictitious scientific perspectives.This, of course, also happened with last year's space thriller Gravity-and please take note, Interstellar is not Gravity. It is undeniable that both are true spectacles to watch, but Interstellar is a much more philosophical and emotional film. It is a surreal journey out of our galaxy and feels vividly alive, all while making you contemplate the realities of humanity and the spectrum of emotions we experience, such as love and how its manner of existence cannot be measured in scientific terms. That being said, Interstellar is a very scientific film, yet it is one that brilliantly manages to balance out with emotional character development and astounding space cinematography. It can feel stark or it can feel mind-bending, and its transitions are superbly executed. Spectacular cinematography and original storytelling come as no surprise when watching a film directed by Christopher Nolan, best known for Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy. His entire filmography is astounding and highly recommended (by me, of course), so those hyped for the film due to his involvement flocked to the theatre-along with Matthew McConaughey's huge fan-base since what has been labeled the McConaissance. A ridiculous term, yes, but let's be thankful he's gone from bad rom-coms to the dramatic roles he's thrived in, from Mud to Dallas Buyers Club.The fact of the matter is, as a piece of cinema, Interstellar stands out. It has many odes to 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Star Wars, due to Nolan's love for sci-fi. However, much unlike these films, Interstellar remains grounded outside of alien life. Whether Interstellar dabbles into the supernatural is cause for debate, due to the film's scientific presentation mixed with fiction. This is precisely why Interstellar is an unprecedented experience. It presents real scientific facts and asks tough philosophical questions, yet remains a grippingly lucid sci-fi film.Discussing Interstellar feels much like presenting someone with a gift and not wanting to give any hints as to what it is. The film's layers are cleverly peeled off and its progression is so beautifully carried out that there is truly nothing like experiencing it and absorbing its concepts and theories after it is over. I suppose I've delayed discussing Interstellar's plot because it is a film in which every plot point is important and imaginative, and giving anything away would feel like giving away a meaningful piece. I will, nevertheless, present you with an introduction and very minor synopsis of the film.Interstellar follows Cooper, played by McConaughey, living with his father-in-law, son, and daughter, in a desolate Earth filled with extreme dust storms. Homes and human lungs are filled with dust as people struggle to survive with limited resources in a deteriorating, and depleting Earth. Cooper is a farmer who once flew for NASA before the Earth's descent, and his crops-along with crops around the entire globe-are dying due to the earth's excessive drought and dust plagues. Upon making entirely unexpected discoveries, Cooper is faced with making the difficult decision of leaving his family for the exploration of planets sustainable of human life in a galaxy outside of our own. With the spectacular Anne Hathaway at his side, not to mention a sarcastic clunky robot, Interstellar becomes a humorous experience as much as it is intellectually stimulating and incredibly moving. This is a film that simply cannot be missed due to its intricacy, beauty, and manner of evoking a response from all those who experience it.",Interstellar
546,winopaul,"Good actors, bad movie",3/10,8 February 2016,"I loved Gravity, since it was an exploration of human drama. I loved the Star Trek remake since it JJ is pretty dang good, and it was all make-believe and whizzy. I hated this movie. There were respites. When Matthew McConaughey's said ""I could fly around that neutron star."" I burst out laughing, it was so preposterous, so absurd and so lame. I will admit, he sold the line. If he can pretend to be imaginary people and lie so effectively, it makes me worry about politicians and my friends.It really scares me that Nolan thinks this movie makes any sense. Has his brain turned to Yorkshire pudding? It was written as a series of dramatic expedients. Like Chris just had to have a dust-bowl, so there was a dust-bowl. And Chris just had to have a big ol' rocket launch. There had to be wormholes and time travel and sinking to the level of M. Night Shyamalan, a twist at the end.Another annoyance is Nolan's British elitism, that farmers are dumb peons that don't need to go to college. Note how Coop loves his troubled intellectual daughter and not the son that ends up feeding the planet.Even with these great actors, the situations were so preposterous it was impossible to feel anything but pity for the agents that got them into this mess. A near-future dystopia, where there are cars and trucks but not phones or letters or internet. No government, but no MS13, Hell's Angels and Mafioso raping your daughter. The occasional pervasive dust storm. But the crops grow OK. Until they don't. And somehow we know the planet is doomed, if only because some jerk says it is.There is a huge NASA installation a few hours drive away, but nobody knows about it. Coop sends co-ordinates so he knows it is there. Nolan might want to ask Kip the science guy about causality and determinism. No government, no gasoline, but we have NASA and suspended animation since Nolan needs that little plot trick. Its a drive-by script-- spray some more clichés at it until they call you a genius.And folks, you can't drive into a black hole. Its not black because its mysterious and can be used for incredibility stupid plot tricks. Its black because it rips everything into elementary particles and then perhaps super-strings. There is no daddy's little time-travel library of earthy delights inside a black hole.This could have been OK, it could have been Mad Max crossed with Groundhog Day. Instead, it is just mush, good to keep infants amused with pretty colors and motion, but complete nonsensical mush for adults. Matt Damon was lucky to get blown out into empty space in that little plot cliché. I felt more empathy for the creature in Aliens getting blown into space than I did for Matt.To recap the 7 places in the movie: Home life--BS situation, BS character interaction. Space central- BS situation, BS characters. Space ship, BS situation, BS characters. Planet one- BS situation. Planet two-- BS situation, BS character, BS interaction. Black hole-- BS everything, and I mean every single thing. Planet 3, BS trite. Home again-- BS situations, BS characters, BS interaction.Please studio heads and finance people stop indulging this madman with his infantile fantasies. Even Lord of the Rings was better than this.At this point I usually imagine how I would save the film. Its not re-shoots, every single scene and every single line is stupid, there is nothing here to save. OK, I have calmed down and I can no more give up on a crappy movie than on a baby drowning in a swimming pool. So, add the roving Mad Max gangs that rip him off and pillage and steal. Then they come for his daughter. The NASA installation is not some secret, its where they have been launching the Skynet robots to control us all, right before things collapsed. So Coop takes his little girl, and commandeers a spacecraft. We need the gal, and the black guy but not the other white guy-- what ever happened to him anyway--- Oh, he drowned in Waterworld. I assume he is some famous high-dollar actor, save the money for special effects. OK, now when I saw the cool black guy, I muttered ""He's as good as dead"" and sure enough, like all cool black guys in every science fiction movie, he died. So lets go against the grain and promise that no matter what, the cool black guy lives. Cut out Waterworld, we already lost the dufus white guy that drowned there. Cut out the black hole-- it is absurd, stupid and insults our intelligence. Cut out the third planet, this script is too complicated as it is.No, they fly to the Matt Damon planet and yeah, he can be a creep. OK, now we have the making of a third act. It revolves around who the women will pick to mate with. Daddy's little girl has grown up, and that science gal is pretty hot as well. I leave it to you to select the ending: 1) The black guy ends up with both of the gals, bless him, and maybe pimps them out (cliche alert). 2) Matt ends up with the daughter, and he beats her and is a drunk (hillbilly heaven). 3) Matthew ends up with his own daughter, since their relationship seemed unhealthy anyway. 4) There are three guys and two gals so pick the guy that ends up alone. 5) The two gals go carpet muncher and leave all the guys in the cold, human race dies. 6) Any two guys being gay leaves both gals for the other guy, unless #5). 7) The Strangelove prodigious breeding ending, where all the guys jump both girls over and over and over and over and over.... well, you get the idea.",Interstellar
547,steven-leibson,A real stinker and even worse in Imax,1/10,30 November 2014,"This movie is a darn shame for it's poor ability to tell a story and I am a bona fide SciFi lover. This movie is a pale imitation of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant SciFi background scratching their heads and asking themselves ""What did I just see? What did it mean?"" Plot synopsis: Earth is dying a slow ecological death. The dust bowl is back, bigger and badder than ever. Crops are failing one by one. All we can grow is corn and you know what happened to Ireland when it tried monoculture: the potato famine. Earth's only hope is to send expeditions through a black hole/wormhole that's conveniently appeared near Saturn.In the movie 2001, the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of Jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane, homicidal computer. In ""Interstellar,"" the mission's hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole. To achieve this mission, a NASA gone underground sends the wobbliest, spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot.The space vehicle that's sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole. It takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole.The special effects and CGI are probably very good in this movie, but seeing it in Imax presented two problems. First, the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large. Second, it's impossible to take in the entire screen. You must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmaker's emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen. This appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in Imax and I keep forgetting about this problem.I really wanted to like this film. I didn't.",Interstellar
548,michael-3204,"Satisfying, but could have been brilliant",6/10,3 October 2016,"There is a truly brilliant movie buried within the ponderousness and self-importance that weighs down ""Interstellar."" Director and co- writer Christopher Nolan has never disappointed with regard to stunning visuals and design -- give this guy a big budget, and he puts it all on screen in spectacular fashion. Unfortunately, he doesn't have as sure a hand with regard to audio quality. Whatever audio effects (or affectations) he goes for, not for the first time in a Nolan film, render some of the dialogue unintelligible. Given some the of more hackneyed and overwrought dialogue that is intelligible, maybe that's for the best. I wouldn't suggest watching ""Interstellar"" with the sound turned down because the parts with dialogue that drag would be interminable -- plus, we'd miss Hans Zimmer's terrific score -- but the first 30 minutes or so might be improved by the sound of silence.For one thing, Matthew McConaughey's irritating, overly emotive, actorly performance is most painful in the film's early scenes. He gets better and less annoying as the film progresses, partly because the screenplay stops burdening his character (""Coop,"" for Cooper -- ugh) with carrying the burden of mankind's horrible mistakes in his drawling delivery. For the record, I don't dislike McConaughey as an actor generally -- he's done some fine work along with some inconsequential drivel -- but he chose here to embrace Coop's dourness and disappointment in a way that helps throw the film off- balance, while his down-home supposed lack of pretension just gets tiresome. I have little doubt that he delivered exactly what Nolan wanted, and what Nolan wanted is the real problem.The rest of the cast fairs much better, though I do wonder how sick Michael Caine must have become at the mention of Dylan Thomas's name. There is a bit of what might be considered stunt casting involving a major Hollywood star who shows up for a pivotal development in our heroes' search for a habitable planet, but far from being distracting or beside-the-point, it helps make for the film's tensest, most gripping and emotionally resonant scenes. While there are other set-pieces that almost get to that level, the odd pacing and sheer weightiness of a film that takes gravity as its main topic ultimately makes this a frustrating watch, if only because it's so beautiful and has so many jumbled ideas that it's easy to imagine it being so much better than it is.",Interstellar
549,OlieRendch,Is this the 2001: A Space Odyssey we wanted but never got?,8/10,13 November 2014,"So, Interstellar; the latest film from the brilliant and awesome director Christopher Nolan. When Inception? Let's start with the things that don't need mentioning because we know what it's like, the acting is perfect, Matthew McConaughey delivers some fantastic scenes of power and emotion which ultimately takes you all through the movie, you're there for him, you want him to succeed; his daughter as well gives out some pretty surprising scenes, the young actress they got was really good. So on an acting front the film was perfect. this film was in production it was wrapped up in so much secrecy that hardly anyone knew what the plot was about and the cast was kept fairly under wraps too. Anyway what can I say about a three hour space epic from the same guy who made Now do I need to mention the CGI? Nolan tried to use as little as possible and use as much practical effects as he could which worked amazingly well but then when CGI hit your face, you didn't even notice, wow, the visuals of this film are nothing less than stunning, the planets, space, everything looks beautiful.The plot is really what drives a film too, Interstellar is a film which isn't for everyone but it is a unique experience for anyone who watches it. It has some obvious inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey but in a good way and it is not a prefect movie in whole. I do have to say it really picks up on the second act, the beginning I felt was quite slow and dragged on a bit and I was hoping it was going to get better, but as soon as they go into the second act it picks up, the story gives you a lot of food for thought, questions that are not very easy to answer and I was definitely thinking about it after the movie ended. Some parts shocked you, some parts will bring you to tears, it is an incredible journey of morals, exploration and desperation.The ending I think will split some people, you either love it or hate it; I look at it positively and loved how they depicted certain physical concepts from science. In the end my opinions on it will probably change with every new thought but I will definitely watch it again which says something.",Interstellar
550,scottsideasare,Almost a great movie.,7/10,24 December 2020,"I really really wanted to love this movie. It ticks off most of the boxes to be great, but blunders heavily in a few areas. It's a long movie and they toss in a dumb subplot with Matt Damon to prop up the sagging middle of the story. The central theme is dopey as well, love reaching through time and space??
But the ending is just plain funny. The main character promises his daughter he'd come back. He does and meets her as an old woman on her deathbed, but he doesn't stick around because in a minute he's off to meet up with his love interest. Wow, way to go keeping your promises!",Interstellar
551,eismoc,"Great, entertaining, amazing",10/10,29 April 2018,"This is a sort of movies that leave some mark when watching it once. The story makes one thinks about the nature, physics, the universe, and life. ""How many thoughts a movie can give"" is a great criterion that I use to decide how much I enjoyed any movie, and Interstellar gave me a lot of new thoughts. After finishing watching this movie I kept imagining those various, interesting situations given in it. The parts dealing with physics in this movie are very well written and directed, and the net result of what it looked like is awesome, just awesome. The story: Perfect, keeps attracting through the movie, until the part is reached when it confuses concepts of time travel at the very end of the movie (I'm not going to spoil it). This is why I didn't rate it a full 10 stars. Everything else is awesome, acting, filmography and directing, visual effects, and (specially) the music! I'd recommend it for physicists-and artists as well.

To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...

553,dgefroh,Interstellar not so stellar,4/10,15 November 2014,"If you are looking for lots of special effects, over-bearing musical score, muddled storyline, and a way to waste 3 hours of your life this movie is for you, but NOT for me. What a huge disappointment this one turned out to be, of course what should I expect from Christopher Nolan after ""Inception"". The concept which could of been terrific was completely and totally lost by focusing way to much on the technical aspects and special effects, leaving what could of been a decent storyline line behind in an effort to explain the complexities of traveling through a space wormhole. That would be good information if you plan on being an astronaut, but if you are just a movie goer, forget-bout-it. IMDb rating for this bore-fest waste of time is way over-blown and extremely misleading. Most movie goers want to be entertained, and space travel is the final frontier and would be a great backdrop for excitement and wonder...i.e. ""Gravity"". Interstellar fails to deliver anything in the way of excitement, suspense, or drama. Yes, the acting is very good by all cast members, but most movie goers want more than stellar acting, they want a story that you can follow, they want to be entertained, and they want whatever time they spend watching a movie to be worthwhile. In this case the movies fails in all counts.",Interstellar
554,foghorn_clj,Stunning visuals cannot make up for storyline that woefully overreaches,2/10,8 November 2014,"Full disclosure: I had ZERO interest in seeing this movie in the first place. But I got dragged along by my friends to see it... and I wish I could get my 3 hours back.There are 4 fundamental issues I have with this movie:1. The lengthNolan could've easily gotten 2 or 3 movies out of the script for this movie. In it's own right each ""acts"" of the story could've stood alone & been amazing. Instead Nolan condenses them together in a narrative that is flat and feels never ending.2. You never connect to any of the characters on an emotional level. McConaughey's performance as the protagonist Cooper, whilst complex enough to keep you mildly interested, fails to hit any emotional notes. Even when he leaves his kids (possibly forever) I didn't care. And hathaway's character was mostly boring/annoying and her speech about love was painfully cliché. 3. The science fiction elements Now I'm no physicist but despite all the study previously completed about black holes we're just supposed to believe that a guy in a ship can fly into a black hole and not be pulled apart & magically escape???? Light can't escape a black hole but this guy can!! Now there's suspending disbelief and there's flagrantly ignoring years of scientific research.Oh and don't even get me started on the inception-style ridiculousness at the end and the magic revelations drawn by cooper and his daughter from thin air. The science makes NO SENSE. 4. TARS the robot As much as I can appreciate Nolan going away from the conventional android-type robot for the film, a robot that rolls across the water in the shape of an asterisk and picks someone up and rolls back??? Come on.On the plus side the robot was the funniest part of the movie (again probably got a great thing).In conclusion: The special effects were amazing but the story was a horrible mis-match of several ideas (some that worked and a lot that didn't).",Interstellar
555,IreneWatsonC,Eternal love,9/10,20 March 2020,"Interstellar is a movie of a complex debate about relativity, gravity and the meaning of time. It discusses how to strike a balance between the emotional exchanges of love, hope and salvation. The background of the film lies in a distant but recognizable future. The planet almost ran out of resources and the nations disbanded. The movie switches between unexplored and disturbing planetary worlds that exist outside the earth.

557,arnieiam,Not Nolan on his A Game,8/10,14 November 2014,"Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry.",Interstellar
558,russellingreviews,Are we keepers of our own fate?,7/10,12 November 2014,"War, drought and famine plague the world of Interstellar. The wars have ceased, but the fight for the basic essentials of life hang in the balance. A blight threatens the food supplies and rolling dust storms cause a dirt-filled existence for civilisation and the Cooper family. Coop (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer who is trying to help the community and his family to survive. As a former pilot, engineer and a recent widow, he is attempting to hold together the very existence of his family. In amongst the trials of life, his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) comes upon a strange anomaly that leads to a series of events that push Coop into a situation that means the salvation of mankind. He is asked to sacrifice his time on the earth by going through a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum to find a new home for humanity. He and a team of scientists, headed by Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), leave earth to find new worlds that can sustain life. Once on the spacecraft Endurance, the crew is confronted with many of the realities of space travel and the nuances of traveling through time. Reminiscent of the historical accounts of early explorers of this world, they have to revert to instincts and their knowledge of the universe to determine which steps to take and what sacrifices need to be made for the salvation of mankind. Laid on a backdrop of space exploration, philosophical and moral challenges occur within the team. Being confronted with humanities biggest frailties and strengths, they have to determine who to trust and where they need to go for the benefit of humanity. Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception) manages to weave a web of psychological drama on the backdrop of science-fiction, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Gravity. The notion of an original film from Christopher Nolan was exciting after the experience of Inception. Interstellar seemed to be the next frontier for his intellectual style of direction and writing. The concept of climate change and war is ripped right out of today's headlines and then overlayed with Kip Thorne's black hole theories make for a fascinating mix of physics and science fiction. A mix that has the potential for allowances for travel throughout time and space. Nolan was able to make the storyline of Inception work, because he made each jump in the film accessible for the audience. With the director skill of previous Nolan experiences, this film seems destined for a new level of filmmaking. Yet, there seemed to be some problems along the way and the film became too clever for its own good. Not that it did not work as a film, it merely did not have the fluidity of previous Nolan films. It will be a film studied by many film classes in the future, because of its philosophy and depictions of a world gone wrong. The story, effects and acting delivered, but the combination feels like too much for even three hours of cinema. Like the humorous MARS and CASE robot characters, the time/space travel components felt clunky and too dense to move the story along effectively. The special effects were amazing and the cinematography was breathtaking at times, which was the saving grace of moving the story along, but not enough to move this from a good film to a great film. McConaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) did well with the roles they were given, but suffered from the the large leaps in the story's time continuum. With all of the tying off of the loose ends of the story added laboriously to the already long film. The film will keep Nolan's loyalists happy but will not appeal to the peripheral fans who have known him for The Dark Knight trilogy. The writing team of Jonathan and Christopher Nolan tried to convey a belief that mankind is the keeper of our own fate. The solution to the problem of mankind is we will grow into a new conscience and develop new abilities to manage the space and world in which we live. The implication is that we hold the answers to the world's problems inside ourselves. Humanity is it's own worst enemy, but we are also the answer. This is probably why the story fell short of answering it's own questions. It did get the problem correct, but missed finding the answer. Interstellar opens the door to a multitude of deep questions and a couple of the biggest being why is the world the way that it is and how can we solve it? The Nolans seem to be going down the right path in looking beyond ourselves with the introduction of the supernatural 'They'. The inclusion of these unexplained characters in the film even allow the scientists to look for supernatural answers. Without giving too much away, their conclusion became an internal answer with eternal implications. They attempt to eliminate God from the equation, but the answer does not add up in the end. The direction and writing became confusing. Was this a psychological thriller, a philosophical art film or a groundbreaking science fiction epic? It was not even clear if the Nolans knew how to describe the film which in the end caused more confusion than entertainment. What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is the problem with the human condition? (Genesis 3, Matthew 15:19, Psalm 51:5) 2. What is the solution to the problem? (John 3:16-21) 3. Who made the heavens?

559,BiiivAL,Theory of everything,9/10,4 June 2018,"How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to ""the most anticipated film of the year"" - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for ""everything, and immediately, and more"", because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the ""Interstellar"", because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper.In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called ""wormhole"", was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population ""from scratch"" - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called ""plan B"". As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, ""fantastic"" plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the ""event horizon"" is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about.For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the ""ordinary"" terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves.
""Interstellar"" amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time.",Interstellar
560,a_sad_cow,Great start then all downhill,6/10,10 November 2014,"The beginning is awesome. Matthew McConaughey establishes himself in what could be one of his greatest roles. The themes of the movie are powerful, covering our inability to forecast/compensate for a changing ecosystem coupled with our stubborn refusal to fund great endeavors like NASA. We do need to get off this planet and that's about where the movie ends for me.Because they're stealing from the Inception/Transcendence genre, we start seeing plot devices for the sake of plot devices, some of which make no sense. This wormhole for instance. Or the tesseract. If humanity doesn't survive Earth, how does it retroactively create the impressive and nearly impossible things they're going to save humanity with. It's the kind of paradox that movie-goers pay good money for and leave good reviews, but it's ultimately garbage.What also got me was the reused tropes. 2 main characters and an extra on a mission. Does this guy die or go crazy? Die. Check, next one goes crazy. Check. And that ending...the whole ""if you want it bad enough, things will turn out good"" bit. Nothing to do with saving yourself.",Interstellar
561,nikashvili,Not one of Nolan's classics that could have been at least more beautiful than Gravity,7/10,25 December 2014,"Imagine the Earth on the edge of extinction, cataclysm and windy storms, that threatens lives of everyone and probably the generation we live with may be the last one. The only way out is to think of new home, where mankind can safely reside with all its species. Interstellar is a story of the voyage that aims saving our civilization and this journey takes place not only within the space, but minds of each character. It's a plain illustration of who we really are, what is our destiny (if there is any), if there is anything superficial than human mind and what is beyond the space we see.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer living with his two kids and father-in-law in the corn fields. He is an ex NASA astronaut, who's given up the job after the tragic incident and abolition of NASA itself. His ten year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) believes that she's seeing ghosts in her room, who try to talk to her, to give some kind of signs but of course, nobody believes it. Until Cooper himself finds encrypted coordinates in the dust storm and gets to secret NASA base. Professor Brand (Michael Cane), who is the head of this secret mission, explains that the organization has been working on options to save humanity, by sending astronauts through a wormhole in another galaxies. Obviously, Cooper turns out to be a perfect candidacy as a pilot to save the world. While deciding to be the hero, his daughter Murphy is not that happy thinking of father gone for indefinite period of time, baring in mind that her ""ghost"" urges to ""STAY"" on the earth. But who listens to kids!So, now retired farmer leaves home with three other astronauts, including Brand (Anne Hathaway) heading to wormhole and landing on Miller planet, where time moves too slowly - an hour of Miller planet equals to 7 years on the Earth. It takes exactly one hour for them to understand that humanity can not survive gigantic waves and they have to seek another options.Without spoiling everything, here is what I think about Interstellar - it could have been so much better in both substantive and visual ways. But it failed to impress and it's just an ordinary sci-fi, with great cast and phenomenal music.No matter how good director Nolan is, he is not that good writer and this film just witnesses it. There is nothing original about the idea of Earth dying, or moving through space to seek safe heaven, there is nothing original in spaceships or different dimensions. The movie lasts 169 mins and there is almost zero character development, all of them are utterly underwritten, maybe except Murphy - she was OK. You could notice nothing much about dialogues or plot twists, except the idea of 5th dimension. Because 5th dimension is a theory, Nolan created three dimension scene (bookshelf scenes in the end) to demonstrate that there can be 5 dimensions where past, present and future are interrelated and you can change any of them.Many people, and mostly freak fans of Nolan, saw number of biblical parallels - for instance, 12 missions sent to space as an allusion of Jesus 12 apostles and that Cooper was 33 when he left Earth to sacrifice himself for other (just like Jesus did?). They can be right, but come on, does referral to the bible count as original? Anyone can do this and think of these analogies and there is nothing exceptional in ""stealing"" ideas from a (pardon to Christians) fantasy book.Nolan has the answer what makes universe work and defines all gravitational, time/space laws - LOVE. Through Hathaway's character, he explains why love should be a moving force for everyone and that love is the power that enhances our survival instinct. Shortly, I found it odd and could not connect much.Another probable reason a sci-fi can be really good is its visuals. Well, we leave in the era after Gravity, which just stunned every single shot in the space and gave totally different understanding what it looks like out there. And logically, Nolan could have outdone it, taking into consideration that actions take place in many different galaxies and planets. But no! Honestly, there was nothing exceptionally good about cinematography or art direction. There were few good shots, but mostly, it all was black, dark and least colorful. While Alfonso Cuarón and Emmanuel Lubezki captured the most beautiful shots of our planet.The most valuable thing in Interstellar was Hans Zimmer's music, which may not be his best work, but it worked well, the main theme was breathtaking and I think he deserves some award love for this work. To compare, this score is nothing close to Inception but it's better than The Dark Knight trilogy.Cast was good. Especially young actress Mackenzie Foy who did a brilliant job portraying young Murphy. She felt very emotional and true all the time and her character was the most sympathetic one to me. McConaughey had a good scene, when he watches a video from his son, who turns out to be grown a lot in the past hour, while he resided on Miller planet. He has an emotional breakdown and even though it's almost silent scene, Matthew's eyes tell it all. But there is something wrong with his performance - he sounded like he whistled all the time, just like he did in The Wolf of Wall Street. It just draw me crazy.Christopher, as a director, could have done more serious work by making the film more technically complicated, visually stunning and creating more consistent plot. Anyone who saw both Gravity and Interstellar will fairly admit that the first one was more impressive and beautiful.",Interstellar
562,jaywensley2004,"Unearthly visuals, earth-bound writing",7/10,8 February 2015,"""Interstellar"" is a reason to go to a movie theater. It earns every penny spent to view it in the best projection format available: IMAX, 70mm, Digital. Spend your money to see Christopher Nolan's vision of ""anywhere but Earth."" You will get your money's worth, and as a bonus, you'll get to see his vision of a near-future Earth that is both glorious and melancholy. Nolan is a member of those film Directors (eg, Lars van Trier, Zack Snyder, James Cameron and of course Stanley Kubrick) who are able to share via film an artistic vision that validates the medium. Film is first and foremost, visual. Film epitomizes the first rule of writing even more than written prose itself: Show, don't tell.An argument could be made that the early 20th Century gave us the best of what film can be. Absent any dialogue except the occasional narrative ""blackboard"" frames, film makers and the performers had to tell their story visually. But I'm not a film ""Luddite"" and I don't support that argument. The ability to include a soundtrack allowed films to tell stories more complex, more nuanced and more culturally and socially important than silent film ever could. But still film is first and foremost; a visual medium.Christopher Nolan understands and uses the palette of film exquisitely. His breakthrough film ""Memento"" is legendary for its ability to require repeated ""viewings"" to understand its shrewdly-(visually) depicted story. ""Inception"" is so filled with visual cues and clues that many people who like/love the movie have, even after repeated viewings, yet to ""see it all."" (What did the top do? Anyone? Anyone?) To date Nolan is best known for his ""'Dark Knight'"" Batman"" films, which owe as much of their success to the ""look"" of them as do the the earlier Tim Burton (another visual director) films. (BTW, I believe Michael Keaton portrayed the Batman better than anyone ever has or will) Christopher Nolan's genius is that he: Understands that film is primarily visual, empathizes with an audience's requirements for visual story-telling and most importantly, can get it on film.All that said, Christopher Nolan is not a great screenwriter. He is very good, but with ""Interstellar,"" like all his films, he needs a script-doctor. Ref: ""Inception."" For me, that film's singular flaw is its failure to involve me emotionally. While Nolan the Director feels through his visuals, a large portion of the audience needs...words. Movie audiences want captions to the pictures. Somewhere, deep inside, I think Christopher Nolan thinks this is a flaw and wants to correct it.Good luck with that.Blah, blah, blah...now, to ""Interstellar."" I saw the film in IMAX Digital with THX sound. As I said at my beginning, ""Interstellar"" rewarded my theater going experience absolutely. Nolan gave me, visually, both an interstellar and a humanity in descent to extinction experience, I can't diminish. Optically and sonically ""Interstellar"" is a state of the art accomplishment. On Earth, Nolan evoked in me fear, anger, frustration, ambition and hope. In his non-Earth I felt curiosity, wonder, ambition, awe and humor.But I never felt human.Many of our best visual directors are great screenwriters; James Cameron and Peter Jackson come to mind. Many are not: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick direct great scripts written primarily by others. Nolan probably belongs among the latter. ""Interstellar"" is prime evidence of this. His best (in my opinion) movies were co-written by screenwriters who understood the verbal element of film making. For lack of this ""Interstellar"" suffers.I look forward to purchasing a Blu-Ray edition of ""Interstellar"" because I want to view the movie. By this I mean I want to turn off the soundtrack and see what is there to be seen. I will also view the film with soundtrack but edited to my own preferences because my opinion is that in its theatrical release, Nolan...tried too hard.Here's my thinking: Nolan wants ""Interstellar"" to be ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" vis State-of-the-art film making. Visually and sonically he accomplishes this goal. ""Interstellar""'s problem is its source material. While ""2001..."" was the product of one of the most sophisticated, erudite and educated imaginations we will ever know (Arthur C. Clark) ""Interstellar"" is the product of a brilliant film maker. Clark was a scientist with the ability to create verbal analogies of his visions, and working with Kubrick we have that vision on film. Nolan is a movie director, possibly the best of his generation, who requires writers who can give him scripts that in their dialogue equate...fulfill, the promise their visual presentations make.To wit: It is one thing to rely on/anticipate your audience's cultural literacy (Ariadne anyone? Anyone?) It is entirely different and pretentious to demand your audience know of and for the purpose of your story embrace ""popular"" physics vis ""black hole's."" Dave becomes a god is literally ""light years"" from ""I am, always have been and always will be.""I am left to wonder what ""Interstellar"" would have been if the script had been in the control of James Cameron, Peter Jackson or even Joss Whedon; Directors who are also accomplished writers. Aside from the marketability of such a ""super-team,"" the product (aka: ""Interstellar"") could have been so much more emotionally powerful it is wondrous to consider.""Interstellar"" is a visual triumph. But unlike the films that suggest it (""2001,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" and others) it lacks the literate/emotional connection that can only be provided by great screen writing. If this is the best Christopher Nolan gives his audience, he will be well remembered and respected. Me? I hope he finds his Muse, the writer who creates scripts worthy of, fulfilling of, his ability to make what he sees available to us.May I suggest Joss Whedon...Thanos looms...",Interstellar
563,xsophietaylorx,Amazing,10/10,20 May 2015,"I am actually disappointed it took me so long to see this film I've missed out! Interstellar just didn't appeal to me I always find sometimes sci if films drags abit or some are very similar really I just have to be in that mood to watch them. Tonight was a sci fi night mood and I decided to watch interstellar and it actually blew me away. Literally the effects, the acting, the story literally everything is out of this world (excuse the pun) but really it is an out stounding film. I love films that make you wonder about things and leave you with an effect this film has made me so interested in space and science. Interstellar is an emotional journey and who doesn't love a good emotional roller coaster I cried a good ten times and that's not an exaggeration the film really does just tap into your emotions and the end scene oh absolutely heart wrenching but so beautifully amazing! Don't make my mistake and take so long to watch it go watch it now

564,Mork_the_Borg,What a complete and utter waste of money,1/10,14 November 2014,"This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million.

565,Mcnabbbeasty,Cinematic Perfection; Greatest Space Film Ever Created.,9/10,4 July 2021,"There could be an argument made that ""Interstellar"" is the greatest film ever created. It is breathtakingly profound in all aspects. From it's mind bending premise executed to perfection to the most encapsulating and nuanced sound environment I've ever experienced in film, ""Interstellar"" is truly a transcendent feat in the art of film making. Christopher Nolan indeed possesses the Midas touch. This classic is the holy grail of Nolan's unparalleled ingenuity and brilliance in cinema, even moreso then his mind bending 2010 masterpiece, ""Inception"". Don't get me wrong, they are both masterful all time great motion pictures but to me, ""Interstellar"" was just more pragmatic and real life like therefore it evokes certain emotions that ""Inception"" couldn't. For me, ""Interstellar"" is absolutely the number one movie I wish I could rewatch again for the first time.

566,bob-rutzel-239-525430,Highly Overrated,5/10,1 April 2015,"Earth is over populated and is running out of food. All crops fail due to the worldwide blight except for corn and in time the corn will fail too. NASA decides to send a ship into space to look for a planet so mankind can survive. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a former NASA pilot and now a corn farmer is chosen to pilot the ship. It's been years since he last flew, but hey, it's like riding a bike. They must have seen McConaughey driving that Lincoln in a commercial and said, ""you know, he could be our pilot.""You need a couple things before sitting down with popcorn to watch this movie: (1) A box of Kleenex, (2) the Remote knowing where the Volume Control is at all times if you watch the DVD as I did. The best part of this movie is the first 45-minutes before blast-off to space. We see the premise which is all about love and family as witnessed between father (Cooper) and daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Yes, it is all about survival too, but love wins out. Here you need the Kleenex at times. On a ride thru the cornfield Cooper and Murph come upon a secret NASA base where the Rocket is. Secret? Didn't the person who planted the corn see the security fences? What were they thinking?Blast-Off: Here you need the Remote because the sound is deafening and not only here but all the way thru the movie. Why the deafening sounds? What were they thinking? And often the music (HA) is loud enough so we cannot really hear all the dialogues among the characters. We get bits and pieces, but there are times we need to know something and cannot. Rewinding the DVD doesn't help all that much. Since we know the movie is about 3-hours long, we cannot waste time doing the rewind bit and we give it a rest. However, most of the conversations are about love, family and survival and we got the jest of all that even though we hear a lot of mumbling. What were they thinking?This is not Star Trek. We cared about the people in that show. Here we do not. There is a lot of Science-speak among the ship's crew, but this loses us most of the time; and how accurate this is cannot be known by us.We are used to a metallic voice from a computer or a soothing voice like we heard by HAL in 2001. Here the computer voice is too human sounding (I looked around thinking this was another crew member) and looks like metallic air vents that can walk. What were they thinking?The acting all around was okay, nothing Oscar Worthy. However, Mackenzie Foy as Murph did stand out. Notables: John Lithgow, Anne Hathaway, William DeVane, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain as the older Murph, Ellen Burstyn as Murph on her death bed, and Matt Damon.Visuals were disappointing for the most part. We see the wings of the ship most of the time. They couldn't help it that the CGI guy had to take a mental health day or was that ""days?"" The shots inside the ship were very good. The mission is to fly to that Wormhole aliens put there so Earth people would find it and go through to a new planet and people of Earth will be saved. Yes, they go through (shades of the TV show SG-1) but later end up going through the Black Hole thinking they can survive and succeed and find a planet. There are 2-twists that surprised us. When the first one hits the action actually starts and woke us up. The next twist is mind-blowing and you won't like it. Like I said, this is overrated. Does it save itself? Barely. What were they thinking? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only 2 F-bombs",Interstellar

569,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Leaves you wondering,9/10,3 April 2015,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch.

570,the-fearless-america,Interstellar can be a lot more powerful if Nolan focusing in one genre into 85%. But it has 50-50 of drama & sci-fi.,8/10,20 March 2015,"i need to say that nolan still not good as a director. he needs to improve his directorial skill, especially in camera-works, art- direction, and script-writing. his cinematography skill also only reach average level. i can explain in deeper detailed facts about nolan's weakness, but i don't want to. let's just talk about this movie, the strengths and it's weaknesses.interstellar, by a comprehensive means and it's factual cinematography and writing, was made for people between 17-23 years old. it is clearly described from the movie itself, that this was made for teenager movie-goers. it is not a movie that needs to be studied by professor of movies. it is a movie about nolan's inner creativity which poured into a working-canvas which has only one purpose, to entertain people at that age range, especially people whose sci-fi addict.the writing. of course for some scenes, interstellar has a good science quote. at first, the writing focusing into a science-basis movie. but too bad, as the movie going, nolan slowly turns the movie and adding scenes which drive the genre into drama-basis. i like the way he made the script, no bad-words or trash-jokes. but in interstellar, he doing fatal mistakes to not focusing in one kind of genre, either pure- sci-fi or sci-fi-drama (which contains more fiction). if he focusing in sci-fi-drama, he can enhance the storyline into something that connected sentimentally with the ending. he could add some romance or relationship-drama scenes in the middle of duration. so in the ending scenes, the viewers will be shaken by a hopeless-astronout act by hathaway. the ending story is good anyway, maybe it is very good. but it was not bonded by a strong drama.then if he focusing in pure-sci-fi. i wished he do this because of high amount of budget that really wasted if he didn't sharpen the visual-quality with beautiful art-direction. he waste the budget into something which have a half-drama and half-sci-fi. too bad nolan, you made a wrong move this time.but i didn't mean to say that this movie bad. this movie is good, but it is only good in the first watching. for the second,third, or the next watch, you will losing your interest, im sure about it. but just watch it guys, it is entertaining at last.",Interstellar

573,prospectus_capricornium,"Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama.",10/10,5 November 2014,"'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars.To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced.At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver.Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through.Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive.'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise.This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)",Interstellar
574,rtp4242,Interstellar: Shoots for the stars.,9/10,8 November 2014,"Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is an engineer by training, relegated to being a farmer because a blight has ravaged the country and the world and farmers are a necessity. Cooper and his daughter Murph (McKenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain, Ellen Burstyn) is led by gravitational anomalies, to a secret NASA installation, where a professor named Brand (Michael Caine) is working on a formula that makes interstellar travel possible. The same gravitational anomalies that brought Cooper and Murph to the NASA installation has opened up a wormhole and revealed three habitable planets in a galaxy that is suddenly within reach to a human population who desperately needs it. Are the gravitational anomalies naturally occurring, or is humankind being led by a heretofore undiscovered intelligence? Does Cooper accept the challenge of finding these new worlds and finding one habitable enough to colonize?There are so many themes explored in Interstellar, that it's difficult to encapsulate them all here. First and foremost, it's a character study, about what motivates man. Is it self-preservation, animated by dark motives, or is it selflessness motivated by love of self and others? The choice is up to mankind. The movie also infers environmental issues by visually recalling the Dust Bowl, there are parts of this movie that seem to use snippets of the Ken Burns documentary The Dust Bowl. There are issues of the government conscripting people, limiting their intellectual mobility, and whitewashing scientific accomplishments of the past. Why does NASA have to operate in secret in this society? That fact in itself speaks volumes. Overlaying all of this is the interplay of father and daughter, the sense of betrayal she feels. Betrayal is a huge theme in this movie explored through many characters in many situations. The story unfolds so beautifully and the science fiction elements are so interestingly intertwined in the film, and so thoughtfully explained that it enhances the movie greatly. The robots are humorous and one resembles and ambulatory monolith a tip of the cap to 2001: A Space Odyssey. I did have a problem with the ending, Chris Nolan does try to tie up some loose ends with the ending, but it strains credulity.The acting is top drawer. McConaughey continues a wonderful string of roles starting with Mud. He gives a nice understated urgency to his role. He leads by example and people are drawn to his leadership. Anne Hathaway turns in another powerhouse performance, with a complex character portrayal of Professor Brand's daughter, Amelia. She has issues of guilt, that her character has to deal with, not only is she not a damsel in distress, she acts heroically at points in the movie. Jessica Chastain plays another complex character, building on her strong roles in Zero Dark Thirty, Mama and The Debt. In this movie, her character has to overcome abandonment issues and pursue her natural love of science. Matt Damon has a small but interesting role, that is integral to the movie. I love his performance.The cinematography is amazing, even before the viewer gets to space. The space scenes are really reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, there are lot of silent scenes, in space and that reminded me of 2001, It's as visually astonishing as Gravity, and all done without green screen or CGI. The movie is nearly 3 hours, but the pacing is exquisite, I never looked at my watch, I just watched the multi- generational space epic unfold before me.For more out of this world reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Interstellar

577,slayerjmk95,"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown",9/10,3 November 2014,"(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",Interstellar
578,roystephen-81252,Another insult to intelligence,1/10,8 February 2016,"I love intelligent sci-fi movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the movie Interstellar clearly wants to emulate) was a real masterpiece that still remains unequalled to this day. I have nothing against slow, introspective SF either. I thoroughly enjoyed Tarkovsky's Solaris, for example.It's not that I dislike Nolan's work. Memento was a brilliant movie. I found The Prestige engaging, too. Inception veered a little close to Hollywood bombast and used some dumb clichés, but was still original and interesting.But this one is just plain bad. Worse, it masquerades itself as an intelligent film when it actually makes no sense at all. For me, that type of pretentiousness is the biggest cinematic sin of all. Hence the 'awful' rating.The build-up is extremely long and boring. Later, the first simple docking manoeuvre is presented as if it was the dramatic climax of the movie. The scenes stretches on and on, and the irritating, minimalistic music tells you you're supposed to bite your nail in excitement. I was bored to death instead. The same thing with the mini-climax that cross-cuts scenes on Earth and Dr Mann's planet (when Mann tries to kill Cooper). No matter how hard Nolan tries to suggest some kind of superhuman drama with the painfully long build-up, irritating music, and cross-cutting, apart form his tricks and the tired clichés, there's nothing there. It's still a long way to go until the end, which - not surprisingly, after so much artificial drama - falls completely flat.The big revelation? I knew as soon as Cooper and his daughter found the message 'from beyond' who the sender would turn out to be.",Interstellar

582,slicedbread117,A Revolutionary Picture,10/10,22 November 2014,"What creates a film worthy of being dubbed, revolutionary? To me, it's an extremely rare film which sets the new standard for it's respective genre or the styles and themes being portrayed in the movie. Films like The Dark Knight, The Godfather, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings were films that, in my opinion, revolutionized their respective genres and styles. To me, Interstellar has achieved that coveted rank: revolutionary.As, at heart, a space exploration film, Interstellar not only delivers, but nearly perfects all aspects you'd expect from a movie of this style. The sense of unending possibilities beyond our solar system, an enthralling depiction of outer space, the beauties and dangers it brings, and a story and set of characters that grasps your heart and mind, tugging at every emotional string your body has to offer. These features are what, at it's core, make Interstellar the masterpiece that it is. The story focuses on the eventual demise of Earth and the intergalactic voyage of a team of astronauts to find a new home for all mankind. While it's more or less a simple premise to start, the events that follow our time with the movie on Earth are anything but simple. Watching the epic travel into the great unknown is nothing short of captivating, showcasing an incredible display of art, wonder and powerful emotion. The visuals and CGI are exceptional enough to make you believe that you're watching live footage from outer space, topped off by what scientists called the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever perceived in film. A black hole that provides some of the most beautifully dangerous scenes in science-fiction film history. Few films truly make me feel wonderfully lost in its magic, but Interstellar does it with ease. By the end of the nearly 3 hour run time, that simple story premise transforms into a mind-bending space epic, one that will leave you searching for answers to the inconceivable ending and also, searching for a breath of air.What sets Interstellar apart from other space stories is not only its phenomenal space en devour, but its equally strong cast. This story is not just one of surviving in space, it's much greater than that. Being tasked with exploring another solar system to save your planet carries heavy, heavy risk, and with that comes heavy emotions. Lead actor Matthew McConaughey has finally turned me into a fan, with his performance as Cooper rightfully giving him a sure nomination for Best Actor this year at the Oscars. Cooper is faced with the decision to potentially never see his children again or to save the human race, with no guarantee of either happening. It's a position for a character that few actors could pull off in a convincing and powerful manner, and McConaughey nails it. Surrounding McConaughey is a magnificent supporting cast. Anne Hathoway, Michael Caine David Gyasi and one other surprise actor all give tremendous depth to an all ready sterling film, with each providing an even deeper sense of emotion, which after all, is one of Interstellar's greatest strengths. The cast successfully prevents the film from becoming dull during human interaction, and instead creates a piece of art that gives you every reason to care about the wonders on screen. No film could be complete without the director, the person whom's vision is the overall goal in making a movie. Luckily for this film, Christopher Nolan is in the chair, and his vision for this picture has furthermore solidified himself as one of the greatest directors of all- time. Nolan is easily my favorite director, with my top movie of all- time, The Dark Knight (along with the entire trilogy) being his creation. Nolan has proved over and over again that his creativity and innovation refuses to quit. Interstellar represents a genuine masterpiece, and one of the most brilliantly executed and written films of recent time. Nolan's brother, Jonathan, also receives high praise for his work as a writer on this film, further progressing his path into greatness. As with previous films such as Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception, Nolan has stepped into a new space in film, set a new standard for that specific genre or style and planted himself as a legend. Bravo Mr. Nolan, bravo.Without a doubt, Interstellar is my clear best film of 2014. No other movie this year even comes close to the sheer amount of emotion and enthrallment that Interstellar delivers. The spectacle of an endless universe with infinite possibilities and mankind's limitations to explore more of those possibilities clash together in this film to make your heart and mind go crazy. You see a sliver of what's beyond our home world, realize its fascinating beauty and danger, then beg to see more. The film captivates, it entertains, it revolutionizes. Sure I've been blown away by movies in the past. I've had my mind twisted and my emotions run high. But I can say, with confidence, that Interstellar is the only film that has literally made me rethink my views on time, space and humanity as a whole. Interstellar is a revolutionary journey, one that will linger in my mind for a long time to come.10/10",Interstellar
583,sickofenjoyingmyself,A little bit mind blowing,9/10,26 November 2016,"I thought that Interstellar was spectacular. It is quite terrifying in a mysterious way and makes the viewer comprehend possibilities that have now been given a fresh approach. I thought that one of the best features was the ability of this movie to create a feeling of other worldliness but within the realms of our comprehension. This enables us to digest what are essentially, extremely complicated theories. The running time is long but apt. The performances of the actors as a whole were great. I thought that Matthew Mcconaughey was accomplished but my one gripe would be the apparent fearlessness of the crew and the rapid progression and escalation of the mission that seemed abrupt and unexplained. It did dent the credibility of the story a little, but the overall vision of the movie and the spectacle itself was very memorable.",Interstellar

Had difficulty knowing what was actually going on at certain points.I guess Nolan was concentrating on the Drama here, on the emotions, however, i still think not paying attention to the details weakened the film. Another problem, was the dialog! several times during the film and at key moments, the dialog was not clear, making it even harder to understand key parts of the plot! not sure if it was a sound editing problem or the writing or was it the actor's delivery of the line!The movie does succeed in terms of the drama and the emotions, i particularly loved the relationship arch between Cooper and his Daughter Murphy. acting was superb from most involved.so to sum it all up, i thought the film was good and entertaining, but suffers from dialog problems and too much Science talk, it was like it was too much ahead of its time, in a bad way. perhaps, in the future, once we discover the 5-D physics, we might appreciate this film more.",Interstellar
585,captainmike-michael,A Beautiful Love Letter Send by Nolan from Outer Space,9/10,5 November 2014,"Unlike his usual blockbuster style, Nolan has challenged both himself and the audiences a greater depth in this stunning space opera creatively. Slightly clinched and flawed in term of plot wise, this pure hard science fiction that stresses a lot on Quantum theories, space elements, astrophysics, time, gravity and the rushing, complex and slightly illogical third act might squeeze one's mind in this heavy 3 hours mission, but the worthy and meaningful dialogues, enormous expansion from the universe in Gravity, strong and connecting relationship between father and daughter have overall made the film entertaining, thrilling and thought-provoking. Hans Zimmer﻿ follows the director's effort in terms of scoring, which the musics sound more emotional, calm and creepy rather than the usual loud and powerful style; award-winning cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema did perfect job to present stunning, immersive and state-of-the-art visual effects of the space, wormholes, black hole and unknown planets beyond our galaxy. It might not be the most epic and perfect film, but this love letter from Nolan which is heavily inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, sending through the time and gravity somehow represents a rare film that begins and ends so beautifully and stellar.",Interstellar

It's actually got the best of thrillers, sciences, scores, emotions, anti-climax and what not! I know if you watched it you'd agree with me.
Matthew McConaughey is fierce and wonderful, Anne Hathaway is beautiful and strong, Hans Zimmer is expressive and genius, and Christopher Nolan is best in what he does !!!

587,ironcraftleague,A fascinating look at our potential future.,8/10,1 March 2019,"I saw this movie and at first, thought it was just cool. It looked cool, it sounded cool, it was just interesting to look at. I didn't realize the full story until I rewatched it. That might be because I was a kid at the time, but now since I finally understand the story, I have a lot more appreciation for this film. The science and realism this movie is grounded in is impressive. Everything felt real and there's were a lot of moments heartbreaking and also kept my attention due to their intensity. The story is very confusing and packed with science so if you don't understand it you need to rewatch it. I got it at the second or third viewing, and I also pay close attention to events concerning the plot. The future this world presents is very interesting to look at and observe. They shroud a lot in mystery or open to interpretation but it's supposed to be like that. The characters are very interesting, especially the robots. The soundtrack is really good, it kept me really invested and it's a key part of the film. So, besides the confusing story its overall a great look at our possible future and a good film. 8/10.

589,SteveMierzejewski,Love is a wormhole...,9/10,3 February 2015,"...and that's a sentence that's probably never been written before.Interstellar is not a movie for everyone. It is a long film and my guess is that many will be asleep by the end of the first hour. It is slow to develop and at times seems like a sequence of university physics lectures on black holes, cosmology, relativity, and quantum physics. Indeed, in order to proceed with the story, it is sometimes necessary to inform the viewer of why what will happen next makes some scientific sense. These lessons are shoehorned in at various points. Scientists themselves may argue over the fine points of some of the physics in the film, but, with a few exceptions, the science is good enough.Now, from what I've just written above, you may think that I would not recommend this picture to anyone. In fact, I would recommend it to everyone. This is because Interstellar is a masterpiece. That's a shaky limb to climb out on, I realize, but even for those who do not like science, there is a payoff. If you like science fiction, you will be satisfied. If you like special effects, you will get them, and, if you like love stories, this, in some ways, is one of the greatest love stories ever written. The idea of the timelessness of love, in all its forms, underpins all the science in this storyand we're back to the wormhole.Despite the high quality of this film, it received no Academy Award nominations for best film and only one minor nomination for best production. This, I believe, shows the shallowness of those involved in selecting these films. Intelligent films have been frequently overlooked in the past. Great films like Inception, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Matrix, Lost in Translation, and even that perennial topper of best films lists, Citizen Kane, never won best picture awards. And remember, Alfred Hitchcock never won an Academy Award for best director.The acting is better than average, but you will not be discussing the quality of the acting when you finish the film. Actually, what you should do is to watch the film again before you reach any conclusions. Anyway, that's what I did. The second time confirmed what I thought. If you look under the scientific veneer of this film, you will see something that will make this, like all great films, timeless. That's just relativity.",Interstellar
590,dinalt10,A classic ??? Really ????,3/10,23 April 2015,"And only gets a 3 because some of the visuals were stunning.I sometimes wonder if I've watched a different version of the film to others, especially films that are so highly rated.This one in particular really is nothing special. Foolishly I bought it on DVD and wish I hadn't................there are far better low budget films out there.So to start with the bad................and I'll leave this as an abridged list, as listing everything wrong with this film would take far too long.1) The speech. May seem strange to mention 'speech' in a film, but Matthew McConaugheys character was barely understandable - mumbling his way through the script, I actually had to turn the subtitles on to understand it.2) The script - a love story ?? Hardly. And you get a scientist like Hathaways character basing her views on love.3) When they go to the planet near the black hole (why base humanitys future on a planet that close to destruction ?), they get stuck there for 23 years or so.............yet their mothership experiences time at a normal rate, with their colleague aging 23 years. And on that note, why didn't their colleague put himself in suspended animation after a year ???? Why wait up when they'd have revived him when they got back.4) What was it with the black hole ??? His ship was being destroyed, yet he ejects in a flimsy space suit and survives.Many more problems with the script, but the main one is not caring about the characters at all. If a film is to be a love story, it needs a heart - this one lacks that completely, which makes the awfulness of the rest of the film too apparent.Avoid this film like the plague.",Interstellar
591,james1844,Not The Film I Expected By A Long Shot,6/10,8 November 2014,"The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed ""overkill"" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion.

594,prolelol,"After re-watching, it's still a masterpiece.",10/10,27 October 2018,"I was so nervous of re-watching this one because it was one of my favorite films from years ago, since it's a pretty long movie, so I worried that this might ruin some things on the revatch. But when I was done, it's still epic in every way and for me it's still one of the best sci-fi films I've seen. Not a huge Nolan fan, but Interstellar was just incredible, emotional and beautiful. The original plot, the visuals, the score, the acting, the writting, were all amazing. The performances were excellent, especially Jessica Chastain, though nothing Oscar worthy. This is an excellent film and an absolute masterpiece of sci-fi films.10/10.

I'd heard that the script was less than perfect, so I went to my local IMAX mainly for a visual treat. Nothing took away my breath. The space scenes uninspiring , the planet scenes were OK not not worth my 3 hours.The plot veers into dreadful sentimentality, and the ""clever parts"" are unconvincing.Having said all that, the end scenes were good, and even moving.""Gravity"" lacked much of a plot, but it looked a lot better than this, and was a lot more enjoyable.

596,garthlotel,So tired of fake positive reviews,6/10,18 April 2018,"I finally watched this movie, only because it had received glowing reviews.But after the first 15 minutes of very boring, sub-standard scenes I realised I had been duped by yet another case of fake positive reviews.At best, this is an okay film to watch with your kids. It contains a few heartwarming messages about love and loyalty, and it tries hard to impress with astrophysics. Unfortunately, the film completely fails to deliver any likeable characters and the science is dubious at best. It's basically an unbelievable, oddly paced, weirdly written science fantasy filled with annoying people that you won't care about because they aren't developed at all. It's certainly not a masterpiece and it's definitely not worth recommending or seeing twice.

597,jcarlos-96740,The true definition of masterpiece,10/10,5 March 2020,"I watched this movie in the cinema in the year that it came out and I absolutely loved it. Today, about 6 years later I've just finished rewatching this and I loved it even more, this movie feels like wine, the older the better. This was probably the only time that I cried in a sci-fi movie like I was watching some love drama, this is extremely touching and poetical! The Visual Effects Oscar was well deserved because the space scenes that this movie delivers are absolutely amazing, not only the ones in space even the shots on Earth were beautiful, but giving this only a Visual Effects Oscar is unfair, and this shows how great this movie is, the fact that even though it got an Oscar still wasn't enough, this deserved Best Picture and Best Director Oscars as well. The main theme soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is probably the best I've ever heard in my life and I think the Best Soundtrack Oscar should've been given to this movie as well, listening to that sound create so many different feelings, is really a masterpiece!
Nolan's work was flawless and you really can't ask more from a director, technically speaking this is perfect.
The narrative and that plot twist were also one of the most remarkable ones in the history of the cinema, and to me personally this is one of the greatest stories a movie ever told, this movie is about humanity, family, love, evolution, science, space, survival, perseverance, really this movie has it all and that fact alongside an unforgettable visual experience will forever make this one of my favorite movies of all time!",Interstellar

600,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Interstellar',8/10,4 February 2015,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Christopher Nolan again hones in on the epic and launches off into the vastness of space that is 'Interstellar', based on the wormhole theory by American theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as one of the executive producers on the film as well). This 2014 science-fiction features a crew of astronauts of whom travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for the human race. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema originally shot the film on anamorphic 35mm and IMAX 70mm photography, capturing the resilient, ineffable beauty of the universe in all of its magnificent infinity one could capture. We as the viewers can only hold on for the ride as we launch into the unexpected and endless realms beyond the safe atmosphere of our home planet as we travel with the team in seeking a new world to call home as ours is slowly deteriorating around us. How is the ride? Let's take a look.Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a rural farm with his family. His 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) believes her room is haunted by a specter behind her bookshelf trying to communicate with her from the netherworld. Discovering the ""ghost"" is an unknown intelligence trying to communicate with them sending coded messages using gravitational waves, it leaves binary coordinates in the dust that direct them straight to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Michael Caine). He reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by alien intelligence, leads to new planets that could possibly sustain life and may offer hope for survival. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the space craft Endurance for their mission, along with the professor's biotechnologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), scientists Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bently) and super-intelligence robots TARS and CASE. Cooper's departure devastates Murph, but he promises her he will return and gives her his watch as a keepsake. They then part on bad terms as Cooper sets of with the team to venture forth into the endless darkness of space in search of the hope of humanity as it hangs in the balance.Nolan peppered his latest work with other outer space film nuances to reverberate the feel more towards his audiences of which he said influenced the picture, with echos from such sci-fi films as '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'The Right Stuff' and Tarkovsky's 'The Mirror', in which he describes the part it played, emulating: ""elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water"". He also compared it to the 1948 Western 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', in which the film reveals its human nature as well.Lengthy, visually resplendent in scope and storyline, thought-provoking and sometimes downright saddening, 'Interstellar' pushes the bar of space-time continuum regarding modern space cinema and blasts us beyond the limits of our familiar planet and imaginations headlong past the eye candy galaxies in search for a possible future among the myriad stars in all of their visual splendor. Truly Nolan's latest remains his most humane and, though thousands of miles above the atmosphere, down-to-earth film to date. 'Inception' in space? You decide.",Interstellar
601,Snappy207,Best Space Movie,9/10,28 July 2021,"Interstellar is inventive, unique, intense and requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate. The soundtrack is stunning and one of the best in film and television as a whole with its ticking nature. Although later central aspects of the film as being possible... because, because. If everything was explained in logic understandable by humans then it would be a 10 out 10, however that is simply not realistic given the path this film takes within its storyline. Overall a must watch for anyone.

603,dutchs-1,Imagine 2001 Where All the Trippy Parts Make Sense,10/10,19 December 2014,"Earth is dying. There's no moralizing about what we did, but a plague is destroying our crops and our atmosphere. Wheat was wiped out last year and okra is dying this year. Since my lifetime consumption of okra would barely fill a salad plate, I had a little trouble picturing that as apocalyptic. Former astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles onto a super-secret NASA facility and is recruited for a mission through a wormhole to try to find a habitable refuge for humanity. What does a wormhole look like? Well, since it looks the same from all directions, logically, a sphere. The problem is that the three potential refuge worlds all orbit a black hole, whose gravity is so intense that time slows dramatically. On the innermost, an hour on the planet equals seven years on earth, meaning the astronauts can't dawdle lest time run out for humanity on earth. As one physicist pointed out, a gravitational field that intense would probably rip any planet to bits. The inner planet is a water world with gigantic tidal waves. The explorers come back to find that 23 years have passed on earth. The next planet is an ice world inhabited by the sole survivor of a previous mission who has lost it. Cooper sends his ship and crew off but decides the answers lie within the black hole. Inside he finds a tesseract that can access any point in space and time. He realizes it was built by some vastly more advanced human civilization in the future, and uses it to send information back to his daughter, enabling her to solve the equations that will make humanity's escape possible. Cooper returns and wakes up in a colony orbiting Saturn, where he is reunited with his now-elderly daughter. This is not a very visually arresting film, indeed, it's very monochromatic. But it has a complex and non-linear plot, the tesseract is convincing, and it's a very interesting exploration of the time paradoxes of space travel and their human meaning.",Interstellar
604,mistarkus,Imaginative and Real Science Fiction,9/10,10 November 2014,"A wonderful, imaginative, and finally real sci-fi premise takes us on a journey to the outer-limits of imagination. Very Imaginative yet keeping within the realms of real science fiction as opposed to fantasy, Interstellar may be what Sci-Fi people have been waiting for since 2001 A Space Odyssey. Interstellar, undeniably influenced by 2001, will likely join 2001 within the pantheon of the greatest sci-fi epics ever made.The film goes on an exciting journey though space to explore other worlds and reaches other dimensions. This premise and story line paired with the big budget extravaganza of wondrous visuals and state of the art effects make for an amazing movie going experience.Attempting to connect this Sci-Fi with mass appeal as opposed to challenging us with novelty as Kubrick did, make Interstellar fall slightly short of that most legendary sci-fi film - 2001. For example, the wonder and amazement of the unknown of space travel will be fused with thriller/action sequences and characters that suddenly and implausibly become evil bad guys, so that the awe and amazement stemming from the unknown of space/time travel alas merge into the more routine, ""entertaining"", unrealistic Hollywood thrill rides with its loud music and edge of your seat, fake scenes. Fortunately those sequences are only a small, ignorable part of the grandiose film. The wonders of space and imagination simply needed to stay within that theme to capture the audience; instead these wonders become diminished by implementing Hollywood drama and emotions expressed by the astronauts chosen to embark on the mission. Feeling a bit miscast, when seeing Ann Hathaway (who plays one of the astronauts) putting on her singing in Les Miserable face, also Matt Damon, and even Mathew McConaughey (despite decent acting from him), led the mesmerizing journey into the unknowns of our universe(successfully accomplished in 2001, where its sterility from its astronauts made the actual outer-space become more of the character), to a mood that is a bit more ordinary and mainstream than some may hope for. I guess I personally wished for a slightly different film, one that didn't need to dwell as much on the human emotional world and chose to be where the setting actually was in outer space. A film explaining a bit more about the scientific phenomenon going on in planet earth that led to the need to seek out habitable planets and more explanations of what is going on in space. By the conclusion, there was a typical Nolanesque, mind bending, brain twisting conclusion challenging the audience to decipher what happened. The truth is the conclusion might be genius and really work brilliantly if it is able to be correctly understood or it might be something meant to be subject to interpretation. These tarnishes could not hold back the film from reaching and attaining those outer-limits. Since the premise and story were undeniably there and visually we were exposed to the imagination of the wonders and awe of space, time and other dimensions.",Interstellar
605,botrytis,Christopher Nolan: The new generational Hero,9/10,22 November 2014,"Review to everyone, but mostly newcomers:I am going to be short here: If you hadn't seen this movie yet, be sure you do it. The whole cinema of ours was full of people from different generations (youngsters, elders) and had fresh emotional experience which is rarely achievable nowadays, and cried a lot. Innovation at its best what is being shown here.Is the movie perfect? Not at all. It wants to be perfect? I have no idea, it's Nolanish that's for sure. It's a hell of a good movie which includes; Delightful visuals (both practical and CGI), AMAZING soundtrack by the genius Hans Zimmer himself, exciting sounds and noises, so audio visually a perfect experience with really innovative and SCIENCE based story, which was produced with the help of the theoretical physicist/astrophysicist – Kip Thorne. Acting? Perfect, believable, and professional. So go see this movie!**Spoiler Alert below**The parallel between the story on Earth and Space was well executed, the apocalyptic feeling reached the whole territory of the movie, even the space itself with its music played with organ under Mann's evil actions and the vintage-like messages from Earth. The Storytelling isn't actually new from Nolan, I mean the structure of the story build up is classical, yet with several fast phased scenes. It's a different sci-fi what you would expect, it's more about the drama and humanism and just then space-thing, even though you get lots of space delights, trust me, even groundbreaking depictions of Wormhole and Black hole itself. Thanks to scientific basis the whole movie is very solid on physical depictions, however it draws parallel with philosophical and psychological meanings too. There are symbolical moments which are very clever, and well fit to the story/theme: -The bookshelf represents the Earthy humans' mind and the boundaries of understanding of life, behind the shelf lies something more and ""unreal"" things, which with cannot be comprehended easily with a simple Earthy mindset. When Cooper is actually in tesseract, he becomes the bridge between this two worlds, contacting with Earth from way-outer space, a place where lies much-much more then we couldn't even think of. -It's just funny how Murph becomes the representant of Murphy's Law itself, showing that there is always light at the end of the tunnel no matter what. The whole movie itself is fresh, and also groundbreaking in some points, which makes it a new-generational Space Odyssey, or Alien. Emotional, Visually awesome, audio-visually marvelous, and the story is huge and complex yet comprehensive mostly. Nolan is a new- generational movie-maker hero, that's for sure.",Interstellar
606,Targe,Mathew and the Amazing Multi-Dimensional Bookshelf,5/10,18 November 2014,"I looked forward to this space epic, and we planned for the IMAX experience to get the full vista of ooh aaah eye popping visuals this movie was promising.What did we get instead?Mathew Mcconnehay crying a lot.A multi-dimensional bookshelf (!?!)An evil Matt Daemon who pops out of nowhere and just as quickly blows himself upThe LUDICROUS notion that NASA would even entertain the idea of relocating Earth to a planet system dangerously close to a black hole.The IMPOSSIBLE achievement of navigating the event horizon of a black hole, because, ""This one is a SOFT black hole...."" WTF????This movie is remarkably similar to 2001, in that: - It is WAY TOO LONG and in serious need of editing. - It involves special things happening near the outer gaseous giant planets. 2001 was Jupiter, this movie, it's Saturn. - It involves the lead protagonist going into a surreal other dimension that possibly involves aliens, with crazy visuals that feel more like a drug trip than a real experience (for an excellent job on a far more realistic looking experience, that would be the end of Contact when she navigates the alien trans-galactic wormhole transit system) - It promises outstanding space visuals, and then gives us precious few, spending most of the time on dusty earth watching people cry. - It has an ominous robot who you are not quite sure of until the end. The robot however is RIDICULOUS, looking like a BLOK character and completely impractical. Perhaps they could have used a suped-up version of the new NASA robot, which is very cool?Very disappointed with this flick, and with the writing for Mathew's character, who could have been much better.

607,janmanuel2,Terrible movie,1/10,18 April 2015,"I admire many of the reviews done by talented writers on IMDb. When my husband and I hate a movie (as we did this one), we enjoy reading reviews by people who feel the same. I don't have the time or energy to write an essay about this movie, so this will be short. It is tedious beyond belief. While Nolan wrote and directed some movies that we loved (like the Batman series and Prestige), maybe it's time for him to give it a rest and get his creativity flowing again. I am shocked that currently this movie is number 23 of all movies. I guarantee that if the general population was voting on movies, this would definitely not be beating movies like Casa Blanca, Alien, ET and many others. This is a flawed system. The movie is so bad and seems like it will never end. I feel like I need therapy after watching this depressing bit of pablum. I didn't finish watching it, as I felt like I was being tortured. My husband did (because even if he hates something, he will finish it). I sat and endured it while I tried to read. I always felt that IMDb was the gold standard for checking on a movies worth, but lately it is so far off base it's ridiculous. I'm attributing that to cult followings of certain directors and in this case, pseudo intellectuals who felt this was some remarkable story. I don't think the critics will say a bad word about him after the Batman series. I think that at some point in the future, when this movie is shown on TV, it's star rating will go down a bit after all the hoopla has died down. I've seen that happen with other movies that were undeservedly praised. If you are looking for some wondrous story about space exploration, I urge you to look elsewhere.",Interstellar

So fighting over its philosophical aspects is diverse.Very glad thqt story turned in travelling with humanity aspects which we often forget to be grateful. Reminds me of the movie Solaris

612,purrlgurrl,A rare gem of a film . . .,10/10,16 November 2014,"A grand adventure into both the unknown and the human heart. Who expects to be moved to tears by a science fiction film? Well, I was deeply, and left the the theater dabbing my eyes. Don't let that scare you away because this is science fiction for the mature and intelligent. It does what the very best science fiction always does, it provokes you to contemplate what it means to be human.I won't try to synopsize the plot because I can't do it justice. Just know that Ann Hathaway's character expresses the film's theme in a moving speech about love's transcendence of the dimensions of time and space.It's hard to single anyone out in a cast where everyone is at the top of their game, but McConaughey is the heart and soul of the film along with Mackenzie Foy as his young daughter Murph. Hathaway proves here again she has a talent deeper than many of her roles have allowed her to display.I read one film critic's description of the film as being a not quite as good version of Kubrick's 2001 for his generation. But, I don't believe that 2001 has held up well over time, in large part because Kubrick's vision was so cold and sterile. Whereas, the Nolans share a vision with genuine heart at its core, which I think makes it the stronger film.Check it out for yourself and see what you think.",Interstellar
613,j-madej,"It will take another 10 years to made me experience another movie the way I've experienced the ""INTERSTELLAR"".",10/10,14 November 2014,"Watching the IMAX version of the ""INTERSTELLAR"" the first time around I sat through in amazement what could be considered, there I will say it, arguably the smartest movie of the decade! The actual experience that is the ""INTERSTELLAR"" goes far beyond the normal movie going event. Nolan shot the movie using 70MM IMAX camera tailored specially for viewers that want to see this movie in all it's glory in IMAX. He used majority of a real locations and stayed away for using CGI. ""INTERSTELLAR"" lensed by Hoyte Van Hoytem takes advantage of not only the size of the screen but most of all it sound capability. Nolan took a full advantage of that and I must say I didn't mind the sound mix one bit.In fact I think in terms of music Hans Zimmer once again outdone himself creating score, that is simple, yet emotionally strong, being an integral part of the storytelling experience. His compositions usually consists of simple few notes that become the emotionally associated with particular character or situation, which is brought back in correct moments of the movie to heighten the emotional impact.Hans Zimmer decided to remove himself form typical orchestral strings motives and opted for more grand organ arrangement that complements the film experience to the perfection. Bravo indeed! Now lets go back to Christopher Nolan and his wonderful filmmaking talent. I must admit I am a long time fan of his work and always admired the fact that he has a talent combining the intellectual art house stories with big scale Hollywood production. ""INTERSTELLAR"" cost 165 million dollars and has been produced by two companies to alleviate the risk, however with Nolan there are no risks involved. He is able to do something unprecedented since the time of Stanley Kubrick maintain the creative control over his movies, something most Hollywood directors struggle with. His previous movies made over 1 billion Dollars each so in some sense he has earned the respect of the industry the hard way. What's need to be noticed is the fact that he writes (together with his brother Jonathan) most of his movies. Some of the best Hollywood directors use someone else's material to create their movies. Not Nolan. The movies he directs are multilayered narratively and I applaud him for challenging the audience intellectually in times when Hollywood majority of time makes movies which are often dumb down, tailored to the average movie goer which they believe is not that bright in the first place. It is very difficult to explain complex issues in science of Physics and do it in a way that common viewer understands without too much of a dialog exposition is very hard. In movies we show the story not tell, therefor we try to avoid long explanations of things that normally we would want to see it visually and not listen to character explain them to us (unless you are Quentin Tarantino who loves long dialogs). This could be only criticism of this otherwise magnificent masterpiece that there is too much exposition explained using dialog. Then again considering the complexity of the story I do think Nolan did amazing job with what could have been overly intellectual approach to complex subjects. Work of Andrei Tarkovsky and Terrence Malick comes to mind watching the ""INTERSTELLAR"" and to be compared to those three filmmakers including Kubrick it is a biggest complement 44 years old director could hope for. The acting is superb with Matthew McConaughey delivering very emotional portrait of a father on a mission to save the humanity but also his beloved daughter Murph played by both Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain respectively who push this epic story in to the importance of relationship between the father and daughter. This is where emotionally strength of 'INTERSTELLAR"" lays. Anne Hathaway playing daughter professor Brand character played soulfully by Michael Caine also delivers one of her better performance being the intellectual counterbalance to more hands on approach of Matthew McConaughey's character. Caine constant reference to the poem by Dylan Tomas ""Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" is nothing more then anthem against dying or passage of time that subsequently ends with our death. Nolan in it's complexity created the story that does not have a clear antagonist. The villain in this movie is TIME that takes away the precious moments between loved ones united by love that is the fuel for their actions. This is precisely why Nolan chose the planet Saturn as the planet where the wormhole is situated around which allowed our heroes venture on to the other part of the galaxy where the possibly habitable worlds resides for the whole humanity to be saved. In antiquity planet Saturn otherwise known as Kronos was the representation of time. This is why symbolically Saturn has such a prominent role in the ""INTERSTELLAR"", it represents the time and material world our protagonist try to fight against. As I mentioned before I strongly feel that this film is one of the smartest piece of filmmaking in this decade and I applaud Nolan for challenging the audience to be thrown in to the beautifully emotional and intellectual at the same time 164 minutes long masterpiece, forever written on to the history of the cinema book as mighty ""INTERSTELLAR"". If you haven't deducted that from this review already, I am blown away by it and I think it will take another 10 years to made me experience another movie the way I've experienced the ""INTERSTELLAR"". Seeing it in IMAX is must for all the real cinema fans because this is what Christopher Nolan intended.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Interstellar

I didn't expect much but I was surprised!The film is quite long but it really motors long at a good pace and has great depth. They have obviously thought about the script and the story which makes it more enjoyable. I can't say I would watch it over and over but it is really a good story, emotional and smart. A really good film which I would recommend to anyone who likes a thinking film. It's is based on scientific facts which I also enjoyed. Wasn't just made up rubbish. Effects are very good and again the actor(s) some of which I don't really like did a great performance.8/10 and that's me being a bit mean.

615,gcarpiceci,Worth a place in the firmament of the top fiction movies ever,10/10,3 March 2016,"This is the story of Cooper and his daughter Murphy. Cooper is a space pilot, at a time when the world needs farmers more than pilots, as the Earth is dyeing and people starve. Cooper is a dreamer, dreaming of the times when ""we used to look up wondering about our space in the stars as opposed to looking at our place in the dirt"". Cooper thinks os being chosen by some mysterious entity to undertake a journey beyond human capabilities, a response to a call to save mankind. This journey will force him to abandon his family and especially his daughter Murph, and will take him along an incredible ride across space and time. The adventure is in itself epic, but what makes it even more engrossing is that the three main themes of the movie (the interstellar trip, the relationship between a father and his daughter and the underlying theme of time) are merged into a story with a wide breadth and with many human touches which make the story highly emotional. Nolan plays very creatively with the theme of time: he bends it, he makes it work like the famous Escher drawing (two hands drawing each other): Cooper is allowed to experience time as a physical dimension, where the past is a mountain to climb and the past is a canyon; but, unlike what he thought, he was not the one that was chosen, Murph was the one chosen to save mankind, and he was just the ""bridge"". All this makes of Interstellar much more than ""just"" a sci-fi movie, though it remains a great example of its genre. Clearly it taps into some some of the iconic all-time sci-fi movies, specifically 2001, but it deserves a space on its own in the firmament of the great fiction movies. Personally, this is one of the movies I have put right at the top, in the Olympus of my most loved movies ever.",Interstellar
616,graestella,Simply A Masterpiece,10/10,8 November 2016,"To all the bad reviewers on here, I have only one thing to say. If you hate Sci-Fi don't watch a Sci-Fi film. Of course you won't like it. Watch Fast and Furious 8, or whatever number they are up to. Even I found this hard to follow in the first few minutes. There was some mumbled dialogue, and the farm bits seemed far from 'Interstellar'. But I stuck with it. Was I glad I did. It just kept on getting better and drew you in. The confusing early scenes explained themselves eventually with a fantastic 'Bootstrap Paradox' that was worthy of Dr Who or Star Trek at their best. The spacecraft were real hardware and models just like in the 1990s. Not cartoon ones like we have become inured to in recent decades. The acting was fantastic. Especially from Matthew McConaughey who proved once and for all that he is brilliant. (Mind you I've liked him since Sahara.) This was an epic that I was still thinking about the next day, which is always a good thing. I loved the homages to 2001 A Space Odyssey. But Nolan has made a film that somehow even surpassed that classic. This DVD won't be going to the charity shop. Ever.

618,keyope,Entertaining but flawed,6/10,22 January 2015,"I thought this film was very watchable and entertaining. At times it's brilliant but at other times it's cringeworthy. Some of the dialogue and forced conversations were straight out of a B Movie. What really bothered me though is that there are some extremely technical conversations that make no sense to the average person and they go on for 5 minutes. At other times there is no explanation for what is happening and I sat there frowning and wondering what was going on. But then some of the obvious plot points were massively over-explained. And then there's the glaring plot holes. Matthew Mcconaughey finds a secret NASA base near his house and when they find out he used to be a space pilot they ask him to fly their new mission for them. So a day later he's on his way into space after a quick ""see ya kids"". This gave the screenwriter the opportunity to use him as the dumbo who constantly asks his crew mates what's going on. I mean, how on earth did a trained NASA pilot not know anything about black holes or wormholes? Don't even get me started on the bit where Matt Damon showed up. Overall this has some magnificent special effects, a few great moments of tension and emotion and some smart plot twists. But because it's all played out so seriously it makes the glaring mistakes stand out. It's like watching the last ever episode of the 70's Battlestar Galactica ""The Return of Starbuck"", but at least that show knew it was a bit of fun. This takes itself very seriously, but it has a talking robot in it that looks like a vending machine. Nuff said.",Interstellar

Interstellar is a Scie-Fie, adventure, action and drama movie and I would like to say that it's also a comedie movie because I really laugh at the begening and you can't be bord because it's too captivating.
Interstellar tells a story about a team who is traveling the space to find a place who is survivable for the umanity, and I loved this story immediately. I think that the plot is one of the most awesome I have ever seen.
The actors played super well specially Matthew McConaghey because sometimes I think he was not human. Anne Hathaway is incredible too , she is so perfect on her roll. The special effects are awesome and the soundtrack give to the scene much more importance because, for example the explosions are very real. To finish I would like to say that if you love space and adventure then you must see this perfect movie

620,Bek204,another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,9/10,27 July 2020,"Interstellar is such a powerful movie, with a powerful story / plot and a powerful drama story.Many people talked about how long the movie is but I didn't mind that at all as long as I don't get bored and I didn't get bored at all. I enjoyed the entire 2h 49m.The first 41 min of the movie were kind of an ''introduction'' and we were getting to know more and more about that journey and what might happen and really loved these 41 min, the movie was building that real slow and gentle without it being boring, it was so good.The story and the script of interstellar were so very beautiful and really well written, felt like the story was so very deep with its meaning and with just everything, I really don't know what else to say.Interstellar's music score was so fantastic, deep and did match with every single scene, It was composed by Hans Zimmer so...what's new, Hans Zimmer always blows our heads.Choosing Mackenzie Foy as the ""young Murph"" and Jessica Chastain as the ""older Murph"" was a very great choice, its like when Mackanzie Foy grows up she'll actually become Jessica Chastain with her attitude and with her look and with just everything. Matthew McConaughey was of course incridble, great acting and he gave us an amazing perfomnace that deserved an Oscar nomination at least. Anne Hathaway wasn't a problem at all, her acting was pretty good but her character was the problem, ""Brand"".
Brand was a weak character, at first I really thought that she'll have a bigger role and specially that she is played by Anne Hathaway, I just didn't feel anything towards that character and felt like she was like any other character in the movie. Michael Caine (plays Professor Brand) was a great choice and his acting was good.The Visual Effects were so mind blowing, I even felt like they were all real and no CGI were used to capture these scenes in space, dafiently deserved an Oscar for that.The Production Design was so very good, wasn't surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was so beautiful. The Costume Designs were okay the only thing that grabbed my attention was Cooper's (played by: Matthew McConaughey) jacket and hair style was pretty cool and did suit him well. I mean the whole movie they go to space so space suits are the only thing they wear so I won't talk about the custom designs.Interstellar is a masterpiece and a movie that I really really enjoyed from beginning to end, hats off to Christopher Nolan and to the whole cast & crew.My rating is: 9.5/10",Interstellar

622,amexspam,The Best Movie In The History of Movies?,7/10,6 November 2014,"I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes - even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made.

What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see.

624,brian_m_hass,"Harsh, Haunting, and Bittersweet",10/10,28 June 2015,"""Interstellar"" was probably one of the finest science-fiction films to be produced in many years. The script was well written; and, the all- star cast gave excellent performances.The story depicted the characters rising above difficult circumstances. When called upon, the characters rose to the occasion to make great sacrifices for the sake of the common good. Although circumstances often strained the characters' personal relationships, the love that the characters felt for one another always won out in the end.Few science-fiction films depict the cold harsh realities of manned space exploration in the way that this movie does. Many other science-fiction films depict interstellar travel as being a safe and convenient process in which characters activate a spacecraft's faster-than-light drive, allowing them to travel to a different star system in a matter of hours. In reality, manned deep space travel can require years, decades, or even centuries; and in extreme cases, the travelers may have to willingly sacrifice their relationships with the loved ones they leave behind on Earth. The universe is not intentionally cruel but is merely indifferent to the concerns of the fragile beings such as humans.""Interstellar"" is a riveting film from start to finish. It never disappoints. The film is highly recommended.",Interstellar
625,andrew-huggett,Boring and dreary,4/10,19 May 2015,"Boring, long soap-opera mishmash of a couple of ideas from '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and 'Contact' (1997). I was extremely disappointed with this film as I had very high expectations for it. I expected advanced aliens and a new beginning for mankind – what I got was human relationships (including a lie told in the best overall interests of humanity) complicated by the time dilation effect of travelling vast distances in space plus the effect of gravity near black holes. The inexplicable and constant switching from IMAX format to Panavision made no logical sense and was just plain irritating. Even the visuals in this film were not all that impressive considering the budget it must have had. 'Contact' is three times over a better film than this dreary mess and '2001: A Space Odyssey' is ten times better. I think the director of this film was too wrapped-up in trying (and failing) to keep the science authentic and the scope of the film epic-like – at the expense of entertaining the audience.",Interstellar

Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's ""Gravity"" and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully.The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters.And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die.This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix.",Interstellar

And who better to lead the charge than Matthew McConaughey. A guy who has completely turned his career around in the past three years and is now consider to be one of the top actors in Hollywood. This movie is incredible to say the least. Interstellar combines interesting concepts and ideas, brilliant script writing and directing to make the most thought provoking and groundbreaking Nolan film yet.This movie was near-perfect too me, but the only thing that kept me from giving it a 9.5/10 was it getting to complicated for it's own good. Towards the end after so much stuff has happened, it gives you more to contemplate just to keep up with whats going on. Still, it does not fall into the same pit as Lucy where towards the end it gets caught in its own complicated story line and it can't get itself out. Also, I feel like they rushed the beginning when they were still on Earth. Nolan seemed as if he wanted to get to space as fast as possible which made the scenes on Earth far less impactful to the audience. I love the acting in films, but in a film like this, the acting is secondary. The primary focus is the special effects. They made entirely new worlds from nothing. Space stations from scratch. Everything imaginable to make this movie believable was created. What I like about Christopher Nolan's films is the fact he tries to use as many ""real environments"" as possible. They were not CGI'd into a spaceship, they were actually in one. What Nolan did to make the acting even greater was he created the imagery before hand. Doing this, the actors reactions to what they saw when they looked out the windows were real. The CGI was still incredible too. The idea and design for the robot they made was breath-taking. They made you believe a futuristic robot could go across any terrain, known or unknown. I firmly believe the CGI could not have been better done and it is, in my opinion, the best in the history of cinema. I would also like to mention I have only ever heard a score for a film this good one other time- Inception. This one might even be better. The music and underscoring conveyed the exact feelings the director wanted the audience to feel at any given moment. The score gave the audience a sense that anything was possible. Anything within our imagination could come true and nothing is ever out of reach. What I love during the film was the special effects, but what I loved so much about Interstellar after watching it was the script writing and directing. The way the Nolan brothers were able to come up with all of the concepts about time relativity and gravity is far beyond me. What I love the most about the script though was how it all came back together at the end. Everything began to make sense. Their were no major plot holes that bothered me throughout or things I could not understand well-enough because the film did not explain it enough. Everything made sense. This film was cast perfectly as well as being written near- perfectly. Matthew McConaughey was a slam-dunk pick to play the lead in the film and he conveyed the perfect normal, but smart loving character needed to make the role work. The scenes where he sees his kids for the first time in years is really amazing because of the overjoyed happy and sad feelings he has to show from seeing his kids grow up without him. Anne Hathaway also did an amazing job and played the part well. The rest of the cast did the best they could with the screen-time they had and I loved the completely unexpected cameo they threw in the film. If you can handle intricate films that you have to pay attention , Interstellar will amaze you. Don't wait to see it at home, the movie theater experience will enhance the film experience a hundred times more. Obviously, I recommend you see Interstellar as your first choice walking into theaters. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Interstellar
628,fawn_jane,Worst Christopher Nolan Movie Ever,7/10,23 November 2014,"When I first saw previews of the movie, I thought it looked really sappy and unappealing. But then I saw it was a Christopher Nolan movie and I thought it had to be good. I love all his movies: Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION. He's made so many great movies, I thought there was no way it could be that bad... well it was.The movie starts out and the premise just makes no sense. I don't understand what humanity's problem is in this movie. Humans survived for literally 100s of thousands of years before farming was invented, but all of sudden we're all going to die just because we can't grow wheat and okra anymore. It isn't explained satisfactorily at all. People have cars and electricity, but they can't have an MRI machine? MRI machines are not that hard to build. The world of Interstellar makes no sense and they don't even try to explain it.But the biggest problem is that the movie is boring, so very boring. We start out on this boring farm. I couldn't wait for the main characters to leave this boring planet, but they just dragged it out with the sappiness and the ""please don't go!"" There are so many scenes that just seem to pointlessly drag on and make you wonder why the editor dropped the ball so much.Then when go off into space it gets a lot more exciting... some of the time. Thinking about grativity, and relativistic time effects is pretty cool, but this is puncuated with some odd interpersonal conflicts that don't really play out in a compelling or sensical way.For some reason Hollywood has decided that romantic relationships aren't compelling anymore. That sort-of makes sense, it's kind of silly when movies are about two people who just met and then all of sudden they fall in love and are willing to kill and die for each other. But they have replaced romantic relationships in movies with something less compelling: boring, undeveloped relationships. The main character has a son and a daughter, but for some reason the father doesn't seem to care that much about his son, and instead the movie revolves around his relationship with the daughter. But honestly, I did not care about them. None of the characters were particularly interesting or likable. You could replace the actors with any other big name actors it would not have made much of a difference.There was so much in the movie that I just plain old didn't understand. A lot of scenes in the movie that were supposed to be exciting and suspenseful just fell flat, because I had no idea what was I was supposed to be rooting for or afraid of happening. Much of it isn't exciting because of the fundamental nature of what is going on on screen... like watching someone trying to figure out the answer to an equation, while some dramatic music plays. That's just not exciting.The worst parts of the movie, besides the nonsense and plot holes, was the weak philosophizing on the nature of love and its relationship to science, and that kind of thing. Blah blah blah evolution, survival instincts. The movie does has depth, but when the characters go off on some philosophical exposition it just comes off as pretentious and shallow. They never make a single point about love that is even slightly original or though-provoking.But the movie isn't all bad. I like the Robot AI character. The movie had some unique visuals and situations that are memorable, they should have been used in a better movie...And so in conclusion, this movie is okay. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to watch.",Interstellar
629,barev-85094,Relativity Self-Taught for the Popcorn crunching Crowd,5/10,14 June 2015,".Back to the Future, reloaded with a bigger budget INTERSTELLAR: viewed at Berlin Sony Ctr. Cinemaxx, FEB. 2015-- Cutting edge pseudoscience from Christopher Nolan. Nolan is noted for making wannabe sophisticated big budget big star films with big special effects that bedazzle the masses but don't hold up to serious scrutiny. interstellar is a perfect example. In this one Nolan plays around with advanced notions of theoretical physics and cosmology such as Einstein's Space-Time Relativity and wormholes leading into parallel universes. To lend authority to this exalted eye-over wool-pull he has consulted with noted Cal Tech physicist Kip Thorne, the go-to scientist for serious reflection on wormholes and possible other universes. What emerges is a pot-pourri of cutting edge wild ideas not too convincingly thrashed through the cosmic mix-master and coupled with a Back to the Future Midwest farm family back story that is mildly entertaining if you don't think about it too hard and just call it Science Fantasy, like Nolans other pictures. Last years Best Actor Oscar winner, Matthew McConnaughey, is back from his winning cowboy with Aids impersonation to star as a good ole country boy farmer who happens to do a little astronaughting on the side. He is engaged by a most unlikely Michael Caine ( think ""Alfie"") in the role of a super scientist leading an ultra-secret interstellar project designed to find a new inhabitable planet for the remains of mankind to escape to, because as we learned from the early scenes back on the farm, the Earth is in the final stages of environmental collapse.The reason Caine's project is so tiptop secret is that they don't want to set off a global panic on our dying planet.Well, to make a very long story short Mac goes off in search of an appropriate wormhole way out there in the greater interstellar beyond accompanied by a beautiful co scientist on board (Ann Hathaway) finds his wormhole, lives to tell about it, and miraculously returns to the original country homestead where he finds that due to Einsteinian relativistic time bending he is now younger than his grandchildren. (e =mc2!) In Part II maybe a few surviving earthlings will be shipped out to beyond the wormhole to carry on the propagation of our species on an exoplanet that is not dying. The details of how this is all worked out would require a report longer than the picture itself. But I must say that, at a commercial screening with a German audience, I was mildly amused and even found Mr. McConnaughey, whom I normally cannot stand, passably acceptable in a role that suits him. Old time actor John Lithgow was gramps in the rocking chair on the porch.Give it five stars out of ten for half-speed (Halfassed) PseudoScience",Interstellar
630,ConsistentlyFalconer,"A journey into space, time, and humanity",10/10,28 June 2015,"The word ""epic"" is often overused - not just with films but also with lie-ins, bowel motions and sandwiches. This, however, is an EPIC film. And it's also a very personal film for Christopher Nolan, which you can see in the way he weaves his various cinematic influences into the different sections of the film but while the influences are strong and clear, this is not just a smug exercise in ""spot the reference"" for the Sci-fi crowd. It's a film that stands on its own well- constructed feet. The scenes on earth Back At The Ol' Homestead never seem hokey; the emotional scenes of loss and isolation out in space really hit home - Particularly, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) watching his children's video messages is absolutely devastating. Meanwhile, the final - bizarre - sequence is about as close to representing its concept cinematically as it's possible to get. Very old fashioned Science Fiction, that section, but with new technologies in filmmaking helping to make it seem all the more plausible.As a musician, of course, I have to mention Hans Zimmer's score. I mean blimey! People complained that it drowned out the dialogue in places, but of course that was Nolan's intention. It's such an overwhelming score, because the situations the characters face are similarly mindblowing. In the rocket launch scene, you really feel pinned back into your chair - and it's not just a case of Nolan turning the volume up; Zimmer's score in these powerful sequences is so dense and majestic, you crumble underneath the sheer weight of it, proving why he's always one step ahead of the pack (every action and science fiction film since The Dark Knight and Inception has copied his ""BWAAAAAAAAAAARP! Dumdumdumdumdumdumdumdumdum BWAAAAAAAAAAAARP!"" score).Erk, I've gone on a bit with this one. But when you see it, you'll know why. Oh yeah - one last thing: how can a ""black hole"" sequence still be impressive these days when you know it's all done on computers anyway? Well this, somehow, manages to be impressive. Because of the guidance of Dr Kip Thorne, it feels so more organic and realistic than a run of the mill sci-fi flick that just puts lots of cool flashing lights and swirly things on the scree. Some people complain this film is overblown and overlong. I think they're wrong, and had it been 4 hours long, I wouldn't have noticed.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",Interstellar
631,jchen-07237,A Meaningful and Breathtaking Movie...,10/10,12 March 2019,"My math tutor, Mr. Lee, actually recommended this movie to me. He told me it was one of the highlights of his movie experiences. I laughed and told him I would watch it, due to his sake. And when I watched it, it was breathtaking. My eyes were glued to the television screen. I didn't even notice my dad walking away to grab a cup of coffee. I was completely trapped into the movie. This movie not only tells a breathtaking story of space and has beautiful photography, it tells about the bond between a father and his family. Cooper is such a strong man. It gets us thinking about what it would be like to have to leave our family and everything we love and care about behind to save all of humanity, only to find that it was all worthless and to hope for the better. It made me cry, seeing Cooper watch the videos of his son growing up, and seeing his daughter all grown up, Murph, for the first time. It was so meaningful. It's a simple and beautiful story. And as a daughter, I thought about what it would be like to not see my father for so many years, as he struggled to save the world. Please watch this movie. You'll be captured by everything it has to offer. This was one of the futuristic stories that actually made my hairs bristle. If we don't do our best to conserve our resources, many people would have to give up everything they need. Thank you for listening.",Interstellar

634,sashamyshkina,"Sorry, but no.",5/10,11 April 2021,"Let me just get one thing out of the way: I'm scared of space. That means that a space movie needs to be *really* good to impress me. Stuff like Ad Astra and Sunshine has tried and failed to impress me in the past, but I went into this after watching Memento and Inception, both of which I thought were great, so I had a slightly bigger shred of hope than usual. This was two and a half hours of my life I wish I could get back.Please note that this review contains spoilers.This is marketed as a space movie. Its name is Interstellar, for crying out loud. But you don't actually get to space until about 30 minutes into the movie. Also, it's never really described what's wrong with the Earth. Why is there dust? How will going to another planet work? You're not really invested into the story. There's no urgency. I didn't care.It starts up okay. The space journey is interesting, and there's a decent amount of action and suspense. In my opinion, everything starts to break down in the third act. I mean, love is the only thing that can cross time and space and unite a father and daughter? Seriously? And then there's just that part where Matthew McConaughey is just... floating in a 4D bookshelf? Honestly, at that point, this movie that seems to have been taking itself more or less seriously breaks down into full-on ridicule.There are also a lot of plot holes. How does the best scientist in the world not know how to operate an airlock? How is Cooper allowed to go into space but is apparently so clueless he is given the rudimentary paper analogy to explain a wormhole? And even more, which I don't have time to get into here. In terms of acting, Matthew McConaughey's performance is slightly flat, whilst Anne Hathaway gives a more interesting performance but is still lacking something.The only thing that actually saves this movie is the visual effects. I mean, it's directed by Christopher Nolan so I knew that I was in for some eye candy, but this was amazing. The black hole shot, in particular, blew me away, as well as the circular space station shot at the end. And of course Hans Zimmer's score was great.All in all, this would have been interesting if it wasn't for the cringe-ness of the last act. Absolutely not Nolan's best.-Sasha.",Interstellar

How could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie?I really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it. The actor list reads like a ""who's who"" of movie stars. But I cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it.Trust me, don't waste 3-hours of your life on this film. You will regret it, just like I do.

At the core of this movie seats only one single emotion - LOVE. What Nolan shows us here , is that, love shapes our universe, and that miracles are real if you carry love with you. 2001 .? well this movie is totally different from what 2001 was, so no point in comparing. i'd say this movie is a lot closer to ""Mission to Mars""(2000) or even 'Contact' which ironically casts Matthew McConaughey. So... is this Nolan's brightest star .?? Not even close ! To me what made Nolan - Nolan, was The Dark Knight. even his 'Inception' was a better movie !",Interstellar
637,SweetWilliam63,Interstellar Not A Smeller,8/10,30 December 2018,"Movies that revolve around time travel can be annoyingly complicated and confusing. ('Arrival', 'Looper', About Time', 'Time Traveller's Wife', etc). Interstellar is not. Infact, it is a surprisingly thoughtful and intriguing science fiction pic with a star studded supporting cast of contemporary Hollywood actors that willl keep you riveted to the screen even at 2 hours and 49 minutes. McConaughey offers a subdued and mature portrayal of a father choosing between his children and their future. Gone is the swagger and annoying aplomb that we've come to expect in an endless array of rom coms. It's the fully established relationships that keep you grounded in a story that could easily overwhelm and set you adrift in mind blowing science fiction concepts related to advanced science, technology, spaceflight and time travel. The effects are spectacular (as we expect today) but without being overbearing or distracting. There are some fun surprises so get out the extra large popcorn but go easy on the soda pop.

Great Sci-Fi simply uses outside abstracts to get to the root of the human condition. Only by leaving the current human condition, can we hope to see as much of the condition as we can. Today, there is hardly any Sci-Fi...and the vast majority of it is what I said at the beginning...simple entertainment. I remember reading a little bit about the movie when it was coming out, and some of the criticisms were that it was too complex. Interesting side note, Inception was too complex for me, and I didn't really follow it as such, but im much better with the medium of sci-fi. Interstellar was probably for those what Inception was for me...cant follow it, but you can tell its rich and deep, even if you cant see it. Now, I was barely holding on to following the climactic scene, but if you can keep yourself from losing hold, you can go on. Its been compared to 2001:A Space Oddesy, and I suppose it sort of is an updated version of it...but I never got the point of 2001, and I attribute that to it being Kubrick and that I probably needed to be tripping to get it.

640,joeravioli,Interstellar? More like insipid.,5/10,25 October 2015,"2001, anyone? That brilliant piece of filmmaking that challenged us to do something that mainstream Hollywood has long since shelved: Think. Use your wonderful brains, people! Remember that films don't have to be simply a means to an end; they can push past our own intellectual limitations, establish beautifully thought-provoking horizons just beyond our reach, and best of all, can be memorable not for what they say, but for what they do. It physically pains me to see promising filmmakers with the appropriate intellectual boundlessness to follow in Kubrick's footsteps pushed to the side in favour of bland individuals with little more than visuals and violence in their creative arsenal. Admittedly, I enjoy my CGI extravaganzas as much as the next guy, and that is why Interstellar is a six-and-a-half-star film in my book. As far as visuals go, it's really, well, stellar. But it is simply too unsatisfying and draws too many parallels with 2001 (without delivering on them) to be considered as anything more.Here's the rundown: Earth is dying. Sandstorms are consuming the world (Mad Max prequel?). Humanity is losing hope. It's all very bleak, but concepts often are. In fact, as far as original settings go, it's rather stirring. The settings in most pre-apocalyptic films are already basically destroyed, but in Interstellar, the bleak atmosphere of impending destruction is done rather well. It invoked within me a surprisingly genuine lack of hope. But this is mostly owing to the fact that this segment of the film was shot in rural Alberta, which is pretty close to where I live, so I was able to recognize the deterioration of the landscape, having been there many times in my childhood.Matthew Mcconaughey stars as Cooper, a retired pilot working on the farm with his son, daughter, and dad. I've always found Mcconaughey's performances to be rather cloying, since the first film I saw him in was Mud and he fit so perfectly into the role that I can't exactly see him doing anything else. Coop's daughter, Murph, finds extraterrestrial messages that send them off to the secret NASA headquarters, which are surprisingly close to their house. Coop meets the head of NASA (Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway). He is then offered the opportunity to leave Earth to find a new home for humanity, which he reluctantly accepts (to the selfish ire of Murph).When the space scenes are actually in space (Saturn, the wormhole, and the black hole), they are undeniably breathtaking. There is a particularly beautiful shot in which the spaceship, little more than a speck in the distance, silently glides past Saturn, kindling a sense of the emptiness, loneliness, and most importantly, sheer vastness of space. But once we step inside the ship, the story and narrative begin to lose their momentum as the actors discuss love, nature, and all sorts of misguided ideas with all the intelligence of, well, actors. The scientific discussions are sort of engaging, but the film would have succeeded just as well had science been left undisturbed.Since we're on the topic of science, let me say this: I don't understand why people revel in Interstellar's scientific accuracy. Films are not textbooks, and if you think they are, you'd probably be better off reading a textbook. You might as well go after The Matrix for being an affront to the laws of physics. And the science in Interstellar is basic stuff. It's thin, easily understood, and easily applied. Notice 2001 had no science. There were no explanations, scientific discussions, nothing. But the question remains: did we need them? Of course not.Anyway, back to Interstellar. After they go through the wormhole (which was put there by unknown sentient beings), they arrive at a solar system orbiting a black hole which has three promising planets. Black holes mess with time, and that concept is played with rather effectively, except for the fact that it turns Murph into an annoyed, peevish Jessica Chastain who takes up too much screen time.And then one of the single most viscous and ridiculous monologues about love takes place. It would have been fine, had Nolan realized that love and science don't mix, and when they do, it just sounds ridiculous. But it happens, and its saccharine sentimentality induces cringes of a ridiculous magnitude. Your reaction to this scene (and perhaps the whole film) is a testimony to your cynicism. Needless to say, this scene made me feel like dung, and when Matt Damon's character sees it fit to do the same thing, I felt even worse. The script is long-winded and pretentious, saying too much when saying less would have a greater effect.However, the docking scene is excellent, a visual marvel among visual marvels, a raucous nod to 2001 that forcefully pushes past Kubrick's weightless spaceship ballet into something that is stunningly intense, but stunningly serene as well.Interstellar's climax is extremely disappointing, a strange mix-up between 2001 and Deus Ex Machina that has the audacity to present itself as profound. Given the buildup of the hopeless ""no escape"" feeling generated by the first bit of the film, the ending is a blatant narrative cop-out that was hastily strung in when the Nolans realized that they already had way too many pages and had to figure out a way to end it, and fast. Which they do, and the audience is greatly the worse for it.Interstellar is a film trapped by the impossibility of its own concept to find itself at a happy ending, its blandly scripted and acted characters, and its desire to be something more, without having the intellectual horsepower and narrative creativity to do so. Perhaps if Interstellar slimmed itself down by discarding its plot, characters, and dialogue, it could have been a fantastic theoretical documentary that swept us into a stunning unknown.",Interstellar

Is what stoned Cooper would say.",10/10,8 July 2015,"While I was watching ""Interstellar"" I kept thinking about Matthew McConaughey's character of Wooderson from ""Dazed and Confused"" mainly because I watched it right before I saw ""Interstellar."" I could not take his character Cooper seriously at first because I could not stop thinking about his stoner counterpart. This was before I saw any of McConaughey's previous triumphs so I was not fully engaged in the McConaissance. McConaughey has proved his acting skills and has really developed into a serious and respectable actor. His performance in ""Interstellar"" was stellar after of course I got over his whole Wooderson thing.Now let me actually start talking about the movie. I thought it was great. I was never bored with it and I was very intrigued to find out where this adventure was going. Though I admit some of the story was overcomplicated especially the science behind it all but after multiple viewings you start to understand it better just like Nolan's previous films like ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception."" This movie did not disappoint and after watching it the film stuck with me and I found myself thinking about it a lot. Overall, this film is a sci-fi masterpiece.I love Christopher Nolan films and he is one of the few directors out there that has consistently made good movies and he is a director that you can rely on. I think the man is a genius. He has the ability to produce pictures that will immerse the audience from start to finish in the worlds that he creates. Also to mention that his films make bank. I am a huge fan of his practical effects as well, which look great in all his movies.""Interstellar"" is another great film from Chirstopher Nolan. He really knows how to bring the best out of his actors. The performances in ""Interstellar"" were really good. The score from frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer was fantastic and really made the movie more impactful. The visual effects I thought were amazing and were well deserving of the Oscar. I was very intrigued by all of the scientific anomalies present in the film and really sparked an interest in space which I have never been big on. In closing, ""Interstellar"" is a classic sci-fi masterpiece that I think most will like and respect for its one of a kind type of movie. The originality of this movie is insane. (In a good way of course)",Interstellar
644,Fighter_Ned,A great sci-fi film with emotions,10/10,30 June 2017,A lot of people will recommend the movie because of Christopher Nolan or visual effects but I'll say watch the movie for the story and for showing the father-daughter emotion so nicely. The scene where Cooper (McConaughey) meets his daughter Murphy before leaving for the mission and the scene where he meets her after the mission are the best ones. Must watch for everyone.,Interstellar
645,t-81966-84968,a brief evaluation,9/10,26 April 2020,"The film's powerful cast lays a solid foundation for a cold space journey. Matthew McConaughey, the oscar-winning actor who won his statuette at the beginning of 2014, has done a good job of playing the role of a father who is caught in a dilemma and put family first. Anne hathaway's dialogue is persuasive in both serious science and the softer parts of her heart; ""Model worker"" Jessica chastain doesn't get much screen time, but as part of her emotional arc, she's pretty good, too.",Interstellar
646,Vishal_s_kumar,Beautiful to behold,10/10,10 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With Interstellar, arguably his first 'true' science-fiction project, Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the mundanity of maths homework but spliced with the fantastic. Opening, tellingly, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near-future setting sees humanity starving, squalid and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post- millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children — ten year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and her older brother Tom (Timothée Chalamet) — lead a life of agrarian survivalism (while, hearteningly, still reading a great many books). But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth: an all-American hero pulled straight from Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide- eyed wonder of the director's youth; a man for whom we are ""explorers and pioneers, not caretakers"", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope. With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. The black abyss rolls out like Magellan's Pacific; an unknowable frontier, final in a way that Roddenberry's never was. According to co-producer Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three-dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modelled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerising visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light. Like the Hubble telescope on an all-night bender, this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity. The planets themselves are no less spectacular. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (replacing Nolan regular Wally Pfister) captures the bleak expanse of southern Iceland as both a watery hell with thousand-foot waves and an icy expanse where even the clouds freeze solid. You'll have to park yourself in front of the biggest screen available to fully appreciate the spectacle. In contrast to the grandeur of space, the ship itself is a scrapyard mutt. Modular and boxy, the Endurance looks like an A-Level CDT workshop, with no hint of aesthetic flourish or extraneous design. Ever the practical filmmaker, Nolan has constructed a functional, utilitarian vessel. Its robotic crew-members, TARS and CASE, are '60s-inspired slabs of chrome; AI encased in LEGO bricks that twist and rearrange to perform complex tasks with minimalist efficiency. Beneath Interstellar's flawless skin, the meat is bloodier and harder to chew. The science comes hard and fast, though Nolans Christopher and Jonah shore up the quantum mechanics with generous expository hand-holding. Astrophysics is the vehicle not the destination, however, and Interstellar's gravitational centre is far more down to Earth. Interstellar scales the heights and plumbs the depths of humanity, pitting the selfish against the selfless, higher morality against survival instinct. As Cooper, scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway) and crew draw closer to their destination, complications require tough decisions; the sanctity of the mission wars with the hope of a return trip. That the undertaking isn't quite as advertised doesn't come as a shock, but the cruelty of the deception lands like a body blow. Nature isn't evil, muses Brand, the only evil in space is what we bring with us. When Interstellar began life back in 2006, Steven Spielberg, not Nolan, was the man in the cockpit; a presence still felt in the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The betrayal of a child abandoned is potent from the outset but the guilt is magnified tenfold when the Endurance's first stop, within the influence of the black hole, means that a few hours stranded planet-side result in two decades passing back on Earth. Cooper's tortured face as he watches his family unspool through 20 years of unanswered video missives is agony, raw and unadorned. Beneath everything else, this is a story about a father and his daughter, the ten-year-old giving way to Jessica Chastain's adult in the blink of a tear-filled eye. With the endless pints of physics chased by shots of moral philosophy, Interstellar can at times feel like a three-year undergraduate course crammed into a three-hour movie. Or, to put it another way, what dinner and a movie with Professor Brian Cox might feel like. The final act compounds the issue, descending into a morass of tesseracts, five-dimensional space and gravitational telephony. It's a dizzying leap from the grounded to the brain- bending that will baffle as many viewers as it inspires. Inception posed questions without clear answers. Interstellar provides all the answers — you just might not understand the question. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. This isn't the outer to Inception's inner space (his dreams-within-dreams are airy popcorn-fodder by comparison), but it does wear its smarts just as proudly. Yet for the first time, here Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. Interstellar is a missive from father to child; a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking. And if the emotional core is clumsily articulated at times, it's no less powerful for it. Brainy, barmy and beautiful to behold, this is Stephen Hawking's Star Trek: a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.",Interstellar
647,thegodfathersaga,the emotional resonance somehow overweighs its poor tendencies,8/10,8 November 2014,"Interstellar is a lesser exercise in reflection than the masterpieces in its genre, but it's a thrilling, emotional, intimate and unpredictable adventure. one that does not slow down its pace for a moment, which is unfortunate because it chooses to tiptoe on certain moments that could have easily enrich the experience by just letting them breathe for a while. the further the film progresses, the more we lose hope for a satisfying resolution. and accordingly, the very basic of human qualities; survival, the quest for knowledge, the will to remain true to one's principles, communication and longevity get tested.perhaps the film's greatest strength to me is how it was able to take an idea so cheesy and poor, whichever way i look at it, that love between humans transcends dimensions and is the physical force to save the world.. running with it and finally bring it home in the best way imaginable way in the tesseract, ultimately making it a tour de force emotionally and visually.despite its many scientific blunders and incompetent dialogue, i think the film means well overall. Interstellar refuses to be just another blockbuster, and dreams of being an epic adventure of grandiose ambition, putting man and his place in the universe in the heart of the intrigue. in its intentions of confronting man with his own mortality and existential legitimacy, there lies a sensible reflections on family and the perpetuation of our species.Interstellar is frequently messy, often in a hurry and restless, occasionally silly and redundant, but substantiates a heartening reflection on love, death, hope and perseverance that somehow overweighs its poor tendencies.",Interstellar
648,MrSelfPaid,Amazing... Trust Nolan,10/10,22 January 2015,"Most Nolan fans - myself included - know that Nolan always has a powerful opening scene that sets the tone of the movie, and a powerful closing scene that stays in our memory a long time afterward. The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception are all examples of movies that follow that trend. Interstellar however, slowly builds up the tempo to a powerful climax reminiscence of TDKR. What this movie has is 'heart', a lot of it. Not since The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have I shed a tear or two, but this movie did it. The final scenes had me leaking like a faulty pipe. Amazing score, amazing story, amazing acting, amazing visuals. TRUST NOLAN.

649,GameAndWatch,Hole lotta love,3/10,15 March 2020,"I like space epics 2001, Silent Running and even Dune. This film starts up on Earth. The world can't sustain crops for whatever reason, we've trashed the planet and our only hope is to go out into space and find a substitute.Magically a farmer who was part of the supposedly defunct space programme stumbles across an underground NASA mission to the stars. And just happens to be the perfect candidate to pilot a rendevouz reconnaissance expedition. Via a recently emerged worm hole.After travelling through the hole they need to rationalise their meet-ups, to use their resources wisely. We then get a wee dram of ridiculous drama. Followed by some interdimensional shenanigans. The end.However, dialogue is crass and pathetic. The crew has no chemistry. 'Coop' the pilot is only paletable later on when he finally shuts his mouth. It starts in an intriguing fashion, and then just gets stupid. The weird space time transend is okay. All in all - absolute rot.2001 or Contact is way more preferential to this film. As others have said it's basically a greatest hits of other sci-fi flicks. There's nothing new here whatsover, and it's no homage or beautiful retelling. I had been looking forward to this, but can firmly say, don't waste your time.",Interstellar
650,mistabobdobolina,Really exceptional,9/10,10 December 2014,"Interstellar has it all: breath-taking adventure, mind-bending spectacle, brain-teasing thought experiments and fascinating science speculation, powerful emotional hooks, strong performances. It actually brings something new to the table in terms of using relativity as a part of the story and a hook for high-stakes adventure, featuring memorable sequences and truly alien environments that the big screen has never seen before. Even the robot sidekicks worked, and I haven't seen a movie that could honestly claim that since ""The Black Hole."" This is the kind of SF people keep telling us can't be made any more... but of course it can. Thanks to Chris Nolan for reminding everyone of that.

651,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Modern Space Masterpiece,10/10,8 November 2014,"Story: We start by following our hero Cooper as he struggles to keep his farm running while the Earth's resources continue to dwindle. Cooper's family starts to get weird messages that he puts together into a message that leads him to NASA. Cooper learns about a mission that could save the remaining people on Earth. The mission involves leaving his family for an unknown amount of time while he travels with a crew through a wormhole in search for another potential world for the human race to move to.I have been waiting for this one all year and I wasn't disappointed, the story aims to challenge us because we are asked plenty of questions. Even though the film is about searching for a new world the core storyline is actually about our hero wanting to keep his promise to his daughter even if it takes her lifetime. With that coming through as the main storyline the bigger picture sometimes get neglected as a few of the scientific questions remained unanswered. This story will end up testing you and keep you guessing from start to finish, this is what will end up going down as the best sci-fi space based film since 2001 Space odyssey. (10/10)Actor ReviewMatthew McConaughey: Cooper our hero who lives and works on one of the few remaining farms along with his two children and father in law. He was always meant for something bigger but as his father in law states he was born 40 years to late or 40 years to early. When he gets a chance to fly the spacecraft to save the human race he is faced with a moral dilemma of leaving his family to save everyone. Matthew gives a great performance showing why he is on everyone's most wanted list in Hollywood. (9/10)Anne Hathaway: Amelia daughter of Professor Brand who has all the intelligence to be on the mission but has never faced the real situation where she has to make decisions that could define the mission. Anne gives a good performance as what turns into the weak link of the team. (8/10)Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain: Murph both playing different ages of Murph who have always challenged in science while keeping hate towards Cooper for leaving them behind. They both give great performance even if they both have only limited screen time. (8/10)Matt Damon: Dr Mann the brilliant Dr Mann as the crew know him as, he lead 12 astronauts through the wormhole with each looking to visit a different potential world. He comes off strange when our crew meets him but he ends up not being everything they thought he would be. Matt gives a good performance as the lone astronaut who just wants to survive. (8/10)Support Cast: Filled with scientists, generations of Cooper's family, two robots with one having a very dry sense of humour and fellow astronauts that all make up the support cast. Every member gives a great performance to help the storyline progress and make us care about every decision that is made.Director Review: Christopher Nolan – In years to come I believe people will still be talking about this for pure quality, The Dark Knight will always be remembered for Heath Ledger's performance and Inception for be a brain twister, this will be the one that people will look back and praise the direction as the subject has always come off short but this will be compared to the greatest for years to come. (10/10)Sci-Fi: Brilliant sci-fi elements used throughout, looking at a future world we need to leave as well as the look at potential interstellar travel. (10/10)Cinematography: Simply breathe taking. (10/10)Music: Hans Zimmer the greatest in the business today gives another brilliant use of music. (10/10)Settings: Each setting makes a great viewing be it the bleak look at Earth of the distance places the crew travel too. (10/10) Special Effects: Unbelievable special effects used throughout to make everything come off as potential real. (10/10)Suggestion: Even though it comes off slightly long this film will be something will talk about for years and is a must watch for everyone. (Watch)Best Part: The heart breaking missed messages from the 23 years lost in a matter of hours.Worst Part: Slightly too long but it would be hard to figure out anything to be cut down.Lessons Learned: Always think outside the boxFunniest Scene: TARS dry comedyOh My God Moment: The spinning attachment.Favourite Quote: Cooper 'We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.'Believability: The science is real and the effects that the Earth goes through.

652,iNickR,What e=mc2 Is In Nolanisms,10/10,4 December 2017,"If this is not in your Top 100 favorite movies of all time, you should hang your head in shame.Every Christopher Nolan movie I've seen so far has made that list. So could be the case with you. Certainly, there are plenty of 'Nolanisms' (idiosyncrasies Director Christopher Nolan adds to most of his movies that few understand absolutely) but that's what I personally like about Nolan's movies. They make you pay attention, think differently, and be introspective. Interstellar is nearly 3- hours (!) of non-stop story telling, and nearly non-stop-Nolanisms, with twists and complicated theories about time travel and relativity and scientific mumbo- jumbo. It's told so well I actually I believe it! In fact, if Nolan were a doomsayer building a spaceship to take me to another planet when the world ends (ie Trump's reelection) I'd sign over my bank accounts and wife right now (ok, maybe not my bank accounts). That's how convincing Interstellar is.Even if none of the theory told here is ever proved, Nolan sure makes a good case for interstellar travel. But I digress. This isn't 'just' a movie for science geeks. I'm sort of a geek, but I'm an idiot and much of the 4th, and now apparently 5th dimension gobbledy gook is way over my inflated head (I still need a calculator for simple equations). But, there is also great story about love and sacrifice and family. On one hand, not having a family myself, I can understand the yearning for wanting to go away and explore space for 50+ Earth years. However, I can also understand the basic need for human interaction and the unconditional love and forgiveness one's family can bring. Having to choose between one or the other is not easy and that's exactly what McConaughey's character must do (although he seems to choose which with very little indecisiveness).There's so much more to this complex movie it's one you may need (want) to see more than once to 'get'. It's in my Top 25 so viewing it again and again is not going to be foreign to me.",Interstellar

654,dukeb0y,"Choppy, and way too long.",1/10,20 May 2015,"I went into this movie with high hopes. Glad I had a DVD to fast forward.Spoilers spoilers spoilers.... OK, the crops are dying and we have a new dust bowl, so far, so good. But it went on and on. (and on and on....and on and on) And as another reviewer pointed out, we have this secret underground NASA base just a stones throw from where his farm is. Uh Huh. OK, So, gee, he 'wanders in'..and will leave the next day on the hidden spaceship to save the world!I buy that, don't you?Now, it did have a GREAT idea, as we go through the wormhole, we 'could' pop out at a different time. Forward in time , and 'MAYBE' backward. OK, this could get interesting, could they pop out BEFORE the dust bowl and return to earth? (and save the world?)Nope.But they do find the other astronauts who went out before them, but I won't give that part away. Land on a few planets.And the robot, at first, I thought, what a CHEAP looking robot, but I took a liking to it. 'He' actually saves the day. His name is TARS. Kind of liked him.I gave it one star to balance out those 9 stars.",Interstellar
655,wilsr,"A truly awful movie, stunningly bad.",1/10,11 April 2015,"Thanks are due to Singapore Air, who put an end to my utter boredom when the aircraft landed and the videos were switched off, towards the end of the scene in what I suppose was some sort of matrix.I mention this because the fact that it was viewed on a 17"" screen with noise cancelling headphones on might be relevant, although I don't think so.One line in this dreadful attempt at an epic sticks in my memory: ""This data makes no sense"". (Ignore the grammar). Correct: very little of this movie makes any sense at all. The characters are hardly defined, the plot - if indeed there is one - is so incoherent that it left me angry, the track is numbingly monotonous and overwhelms much of the dialogue and the ""science"" (my quotes) is infantile.If the makers of the movie (and I say makers because the director is only one of the guilty, albeit the one accountable) had any inkling as to where the storyline was going, I do wish they had taken the trouble to share the information, because frankly I hadn't a clue. Perhaps I was too engaged with counting the constant barrage of laughable improbabilities to follow the flashbacks and flashforwards.A film attempting to explain such things as time relativity and black holes to the uninitiated needs to use the concepts in a logical way. Falling back again and again on fantasy rather than developing the sci-fi theme is the sign of a failure of imagination, not the reverse.You will notice that I make no mention of the cgi or use of stunts: good or bad they cannot rescue a dog of a storyline. I felt zero connection with any of the characters because none showed any sort of believability. A long retired astronaut cum farmer gets into a spaceship and immediately knows its systems? The ship itself is built, hidden from the world, by a handful of people? A robot made of chunky blocks can manipulate switches let alone run around on and in water and ice? Etcetera etcetera. Please.....Again, thanks to the airline for saving me the ten bucks that I was actually looking forward to spending at the cinema, having read the glowing critics' reviews of this movie.",Interstellar
656,lexva5,Age Inducing Boredom,3/10,23 February 2018,"This must be one of Nolan's most boring films despite its high intentions. Matthew McConaughey seemed as fake as ever in this movie and hated his accent (my subjective opinion) and the dialogue was as real as mickey mouse. When the time came to watch footage of his aging children, from his spaceshp, and he cried profusely, I took the hint and stopped watching.
There were a couple effects to behold and initially the story seemed intriguing. However after one hour of watching this drivel I really felt like I was wasting my time. Also felt there was no chemistry between actors as well, nothing to hold the film together not even the spaceship.
The final solution and the way our hero enters into the 5th dimension is hilarious rather than intriguing. Contact was a much better film on an emotional and metaphysical level than this well made snoozefest.

This movie falls behind those two authentic masterpieces. why? 1) Even though the storyline is exciting, its too much dragged and lot of exaggerated philosophy.. 2) existence of 3 planets just near black-hole is crazy and i am not sure its even possible provided these things existed in the first place. how is waves existing in 1st planet?? 3)Coop traveling and surviving through black-hole.. pure pulp fiction..he would have evaporated in a jiffy..a tesseract built for him.. by humans.. in near future.. all shown on screen for few minutes.. Nolan.. you need to be smarter than Inception..but you fall short in execution..Nevertheless this movie needs to be seen and studied if you love space-time, 5-dimensional world.. etc etc.. Cinematography is breathtaking.. Overall i didn't feel as emotional as i was after watching inception.. i mean bottom-line for me is.. this movie shows flashes of brilliance but no worthy match to the 2 movies i mentioned before.. Its my opinion..:-)

658,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,The movie Christopher Nolan was destined to make.,7/10,7 November 2014,"Nolan has come a long way since the days of Batman for he has now transcended to becoming one of the most important directors of today's generation. Ever since Inception, I always dreamt of Christopher Nolan daring to aim higher, to go where few directors have succeeded, to explore ideas that are beyond epic in scope. And now he brings to us his perfect creation: Interstellar. It is a film that isn't just a visual extravaganza but also asks the inevitable big question of travelling beyond our own planet and solar system to expand the canvas of your own existence with real science but also being supported by this strong emotional human story.Interstellar begins in a point in a time from now where the world is more concerned with trying to keep on existing on our planet then trying to make new discoveries to leave it. Current issues like climate change and world hunger are the major risks that humans face in this difficult future. But when a wormhole appears near Saturn, it seems humanity prays for salvation have been answered by powerful otherworldly beings. Nolan does not show this future Earth as being a hi-tech one like so many movies have done nor looking apocalyptic but yet still feels by acknowledging the major issues it faces. This is a world that has ceased moving forward technologically in order to focus more time and resources to preserve the last agricultural crop (corn) for food. There is even a very interesting nod to the Apollo moon landing conspiracy that sneaks its way in.Nolan has a great eye for detail but in a very practical. Once our cast of explorers reach into space, you sense the awe and suspense, as the scenes in outer space feel so real and haunting while on the alien planets leave you with beauty and wonder as Chistropher Nolan prefers to shoot on real locations like Iceland rather then a green-screen set. Another good note are the two robots CASE and TARS who are essentially mobile rectangles with the latter surprisingly becomes the film's sarcastic comic relief.The real heart of this story is the relationship between Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain). As the film's theme is about us as a species abandoning our home to find a new one in the great unknown, it asks the more personal question about leaving behind the things we love the most like family. As Cooper most go on this mission ensure his daughter's future but while at the same time meaning he has to leave her behind, he is unsure when or even if he will ever return. McConaughey brings a very serious, emotional and dramatic performance for Cooper. Mackenzie Foy will definitely become one of latest rising young actresses. Chastain also bring a very intelligent and emotional performance to the adult version of Murphy. Other great performances go to Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway.This I would not only say this to be the best movie of this year but also one of the important movies ever made. It questions the purpose of existence by asking what will we start new but also what will leave behind. Will we sacrifice what we have left to continue our future? Will we the leave the safety of our home to explore the mysterious of universe? Is our destiny tied to a greater purpose? Should we think as individual by letting our emotions guides us or do we make sacrifices to help the greater good? Nolan has crafted a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time.",Interstellar
659,f-rabit,My favourite movie,10/10,9 December 2014,"This is actually my nº 1 movie in the best ever list. Absolutely astonishing. Mathew delivers the best performance of his career. Everything about this movie is great and near perfection. The picture is awesome, the soundtrack breathtaking, the story is very griping, the actors are superb. I guess this movie will make a fuzz at the Oscars. Can't understand how some guys rated it so badly. The premiss of the story is scientifically very strong also and I've heard that it's one of the most accurate movies concerning to astrophysics. I can't understand why there's a minimum of ten lines to post the review. Sometimes you don't have to say much to say that this movie is one of the best sci-fi ever.

660,dholliday-imdb,"boring, formulaic, annoying, uninspired",3/10,7 March 2015,"I hovered for a while over 5/10, but then this isn't an average film...it's below-average. There's not much to recommend it other than McConaughey's decent performance.Here's a few things that's wrong with this picture: the daughter is, to put it bluntly, a stuck-up bitch to her Dad: surely the most undeserving daughter in the entire universe of a reunion with a long-lost father. At least that's how she was portrayed.the premise is pure shlock daftness: it's a silly idea dreamt up as any old excuse for the journey. And I say this as a hard sci-fi fan (or rather, hard sci-fi taught me that the premise in a story was important).the effects are cheap-looking, even wobbly at some points! How on Earth 99% of viewers applaud the effects is truly lost on me. It just looks like a budget TV version of Lost In Space.there's a lot of crying...a lot. Cheesy as hell.the black character dies (obviously not a spoiler).there's some formulaic conflict later in the film which is just dumb and predictable. Don't expect high-end existentialist conflict ala Hal-9000 vs Dave Bowman.the moments of 'tension' are anything but. They're just boring and overlong. The music doesn't fit (sounds like a hyper-ventilating hysterical version of the brilliantly-understated Jonny Greenwood Soundtrack from There Will Be Blood).the other planets' visuals were dull, grey and utterly uninspired.the resolution was more soap opera than science fiction...and the obligatory wormhole/psychedelic sequence was soul-crushingly down-to-Earth. I felt the urge to leave the cinema early at least 3 times.It's not a 1/10 or 2/10, for those are reserved for the absolute worst film I'd consider rating (something like Pacific Rim or Sphere). But 5/10 is genuinely too kind, considering all the things wrong with it. For some perspective: I largely agree with the high scores of all the other films in the IMDb Top 20, and Nolan's last two Batmans are worth a 7/10 (Inception's an 8). Interstellar is just one of those films where I don't for the life of me understand the praise. Recommended for emotional girls with daddy issues.",Interstellar
661,benjaminburt,Nolan taps into Zeitgeist,5/10,24 August 2017,"Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film.Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time.So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age.Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit.Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe.Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it.",Interstellar
662,prietoheitor,"Too long to be amazing, but still tall and reflective!",8/10,19 January 2021,"Christopher Nolan's impressively contemplative film has more than enough to present us with a great visual spectacle with respectful performances, even though its length may be too long to make this film unforgettable.

663,FandomFanatic21,The end of Earth will not be the end of us...,9/10,17 April 2018,"Interstellar is one movie you can never forget. The movie is mind bending and gets you thinking. The idea was marvelously thought out and deserves to be seen by many. There are twists, ups, downs, and even sides to sides. Enough to keep you on the edge of your seat! This film really explores the idea of space time continuum with great acting performances by Matthew Mcconaughey and supporting actress Anne Hathaway. A great sci-fi film for the centuries. Watch Interstellar and figure the puzzle for yourself as you will certainly be blown away by the sheer magic of this film!""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.""-Cooper, Interstellar

664,razvan-rogoz,Deserves #1 on IMDb,10/10,28 November 2014,"Simply put it, this is a masterpiece.I had no expectations when I went to see this movie. The ""complaining"" brigade on IMDb made this happen, since they are always unsatisfied.However, even if the action lost momentum in some parts and the movie is LONG (almost 3 hours), it is simply a masterpiece. From the story, to the acting, to the soundtrack (search ""No time for caution"" on YouTube) to the bitter sweet conclusion, to the fact that 99% of the movie is actually scientific (and yes, I've searched that up), it is the best movie I have ever seen. If you thought movies like Inception can blow your mind, then watch this.

665,antoinebachmann,Masterpiece?,9/10,4 April 2015,"For me Interstellar ranks right up there:strong story. Sure, some of the themes might have already been used in either films or books, but the fact is that this film puts them together in a solid and enjoyable manner. And it's not just strong: it's beautiful, and moving. So you don't have to be a sci-fi buff to enjoy it.strong characters. I've heard some people complain that some characters were thin - I wholeheartedly disagree and on the contrary, I find that the key parts are very solid and credible. I have also enjoyed it that the actors have pretty much all been used outside of their perceived comfort zone, or at any rate the standard kind of parts people general give them.beautiful photography and beautiful special effects. I mean all the scenes on Earth are just truly beautifully photographed, period. As for the special effects I think it has been advertised enough (and I don't want to spoil anything) how a top astrophysicist has advised on some key natural or artificial objects that play a key part in the plot.lasting value. Clearly the film at times looks back at ""2001 A Space Odyssey"". But unlike many who've tried this before, it actually manages to come up with a couple extremely memorable scenes of its own. Well done!So is there nothing wrong with Interstellar? Sure there is! There is at least one plot hole or at least wrong logic (can't say more or else would reveal some plot). And there are a few things in physics that don't add up at all: such as how strong gravity would have to be to slow time down by over 60'000 times (so strong that you and your spaceship would be ripped to shreds and a planet could not even exist); or that when you travel to a zone where time is slowed so much by gravity you get affected on the way in then back and not just while sitting there; or how it is that you need a 3-stage rocket to lift off a spacecraft from Earth, but later on the same craft lifts off a similar size planet off its own power. But frankly, somehow I found I could put these matters aside and still have all my enjoyment. it's just one more case of ""too bad they spent so much time getting the black hole and the wormhole right, but got so much of the rest of the physics wrong"".Watch it!",Interstellar
666,haosstoposto,"Too much hype, typical for a Christopher Nolan movie",7/10,18 November 2014,"As a sci-fi fan I must say that I expected more from this movie but as usual the hype was too strong, and it still is, considering the IMDb votes. Some movie critics compared this movie with 2001: Odysee in Space, but it is not so remarkable. I will not say much about the story but there are some classic sci-fi motifs incorporated into it, like themes of dying Earth, exploration of deep space and the ways to do it with simple rockets, wormholes, time-dilatation, time-travel and some humanocentric ending. All these sci-fi (or science) concepts are for themselves fascinating and tantalizing, but the overall result of the movie is underwhelming. It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong, but some ingredient in the movie is missing. Perhaps it was all too much at the same time. On the bright side, the human element of the story is nicely done and we see how much of a sacrifice exploration and distance, both in space and in time, can be. Many things were obvious in the movie, for example betrayal of dr.Mann, and perhaps it should have been done in some different manner. And of course, it is not clear (at least not to me) how and why data from the inside of the black hole helped Humanity to survive doomed Earth. So, all in all we have some mediocre sci-fi movie pretending to have some hard physics in it. Sometimes it is exciting, and at the times it is boring. If you want to see Matthew McConaughey in an excellent sci-fi movie, go see Contact.",Interstellar
667,FallsDownz,"""Interstellar is undeniable beautiful movie with interesting story about space but without it the movie start to fall apart""",7/10,9 November 2014,"This movie probably has a lot of hype around it and it probably deserve it too because the director is Christopher Nolan ( The Dark Knight , Momento ) and he's probably one of the most innovative director of the main stream cinema right now.Interstellar is a beautiful movie i can't say otherwise at all with it's space CG and cinematography it's a really good looking movie with a lot of theory about space , time and black hole to find the way to help our world that dying in the future.The soundtrack of the movie by Hans Zimmer is still really good and when combine his soundtrack to the beautiful CG of the movie make it's so exciting and fun movie to watch .But honestly when you remove that CG and soundtrack out of the movie it start to fall apart because it's own script and theme is still pretty predictable and kind of a repetitive to i mean the story about ""save the world"" and have to go out to space isn't that kind of a remind you of a lot of movie for example Armageddon , 2001 Space odyssey etc. ? i mean i like it's idea about family and love is the main idea but the problem is the movie just doesn't do enough job to make me care about the characters that much especially female characters in this movie which treated like the emotional out of reason sex which is kind of a not fair .Overall Interstellar is a movie that stun you with it's visual , emotional and theory about space but when you actually see through all of it's visual to it's core script and main idea it's still predictable and repetitive , is it fun movie ? yes Is it a good movie ? yes but is it the best movie of Christopher Nolan and the best movie of this year ? i have to say no.",Interstellar
668,CrisMovieCorner,An emotional thrill ride into the unthinkable,10/10,25 March 2015,"Christopher Nolan does it again, it is like Nolan was destined from his early days to go down in history as one of the greats, not only is the man creating history making films he is also partially responsible for the revival of the comic world we know and love today. Interstellar isn't Nolan's first Science Fiction film, that was Inception in 2010, however this is his first full fledged Science Fiction in my opinion, no disrespect to Inception.If you have been a fan of Nolan's previous work, which if you are not, then Interstellar is the one that will make you fall in love with this genius' work. The film is a complex story driven film that will leave you in awe of not just the complexity of the story, but the sheer beauty of what Nolan and his crew have created. I do not want to give too much of the story away, however, I will say that the film is full of twists and turns in typical Nolan fashion, but he doesn't rely on them to keep the film moving forward. The pacing of the film was incredible, while you will know you are being pulled in by twists, you tend to forget that is happening by Nolan's use of action, drama and visuals you can not even begin to imagine.I have said previously I was not one for soundtracks or scores, however, after watching this film I truly understand why many people are in love with that aspect of films. Hans Zimmer delivers a score that does itself what Nolan does with his script, the music is so beautifully pace that you are drawn in deep by it even though it did kind of remind me of a 70/80's Horror film. It wasn't just Zimmer's score that was a beautiful addition to the film, the use of sound while in space, well the lack there of was incredible. Outside of the spaceship Nolan went with the use of no sound at all, which really was a terrifying choice, any scene outside the ship really makes you feel insignificant as a creature. The Alien tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"" will play on your mind every time the camera switches to the exterior. I could continue to talk about the sound, but I can guarantee I would run out of superlatives in no time.This is my first time experiencing Matthew McConaughey in his new lease on acting, I was personally more used to his acting from Two For The Money, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and Contact not exactly roles that he shone in. So talk of his revived and seemingly meteoric increase in acting ability was something I was apprehensive about, I am to happy to say my apprehensions were extremely wrong about Mr McConaughey's acting ability, he was completely stellar (yes I did just say that, deal with it) I was pleasantly surprised with how far he has came, the emotions he went through in the film were completely believable and felt relatable. On the other hand I have never been a lover of Anne Hatheway's acting, I have always found her to be boring and this film was no different, she was very monotone and annoying and just not good in my opinion. The rest of the cast a collective were pretty good as well, I mean can you really go wrong with Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow and Matt Damon? I for one can not see how you can. Plus CASE and TARS, two robots you will absolutely love and that I can say with 100% certainty, they were hilarious and great additions to the film.Now onto what makes Interstellar an instant classic, the visual effects, I say visual effects they are more art than an addition to the film. They are not like the visual effects you will see in your every day film, these are truly a spectacle to behold, they will go down in history as some of the greatest visual effects in any film. There was scenes I will not divulge details as to not take away from their beauty, that you will just sit back in your chair and exhale in just awe and amazement. Some of the scenes were so beautiful I would even go as far as to say they would rival Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography we seen in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that may seem like a bold statement to make but if you have seen both films I hope you can see where I am coming from.Overall, the film was a truly a thrill ride, from the ultimate heights of landing on new planets looking for a new home for the human race, to the complete lows of losing the last hope for humanity. While the visual effects are truly out of this world, you do not forget throughout the entire film that is at heart a story about a father and daughter. The film should not only appeal to Science Fiction fans, it should be appealing to all films alike. A mixture of a beautiful story, great acting and unfathomable special effects that leave you craving more science fiction in your life. This film is truly a modern masterpiece and it pains me to say I missed it in the cinema, because this on the big screen would have been one of the best cinematic experiences in anybodies lives.",Interstellar
669,InMyHonestOpinion,Stunning and real mind trip,9/10,26 December 2014,"This is another one of those films that I have longed to see for more years than I can actually remember, I believe it was about seven years ago when I first heard about an out of this world space adventure, a couple of things appealed firstly Steven Spielberg directing another space masterpiece and second travelling through black holes. I went into this film with a very open mind knowing that the original script had been re written I wasn't too sure what to expect. I have this thing I do when I'm waiting for a particular film that has the potential to blow my mind and that is ignore it until it is released and I get to see it. A lot of the times my want and need for what I'm about to watch to be perfect destroys what it is I actually end up seeing though and I give it a half arsed rating due to letting me down so hard. This film if you are unaware has been in the works since about 2006, back then it was written by Johnathan Nolan (the Prestige, The Dark Knight) and was to be directed by Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T) Mr. Spielberg decided he'd leave the project because he couldn't find the right vision needed, since then the script has been rewritten by both Johnathon and Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight), Christopher had a few new ideas to add to the story (no spoilers sweetie) and changed a few other ideas as well. Sometime in the near future the Earth has been devastated, global warming having a major part to play. Armies have been disbanded, no animals exist and the only real food available is corn, being a farmer is considered a very well highly respected career. Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club, Magic Mike) is one of these well respected farmers but before the dirt storms and the collapse of the world Cooper was actually an Engineer who flew craft for NASA. Cooper and his daughter Murphy played by Mackenzie Foy when young (and Jessica Chastain in later years) find secret coded messages from an unknown source, they travel to a remote base where they meet Professor Brand played by Michael Cain (The Dark Knight, The Prestige) Cooper soon learns that world is about to die and he is needed to piolet a ship through a wormhole that has been found near Saturn. A space ship has been created with the plan of flying through the found wormhole to another galaxy, a galaxy where probes have already been sent as well as other humans to ensure these planets are climatisable. Dr. Brand played by Anne Hathaway (Les Miserables, Ella Enchanted) joins Cooper as well as 3 others and they set off on their trip of a lifetime leaving all they love behind with the knowledge that someday they will return and rescue the Earth and her people. There is so much right with this movie, I'm in no way a scientific person and I'm not going to say I knew exactly what was happening but from what I could tell it all made perfect sense to me. Apparently the science behind the film is so right, well as right as it can be without having exact proof anyway. Things I have always heard like in space there is no sound is used throughout the film as well. It made it so much more real, it really surprised me how much impact it actually made to the film. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen and the score is amazing, there is no way they could have made the score any better, Hans Zimmer has excelled here. The cinematography is amazing as well, from its Earth corn row fields to the isolated icy cold sparse rocky alien worlds. I never knew Iceland where they filmed two of the planets was so gorgeous. Behind this film mostly is a love story, but not the love we have all come to expect it's more the love between a father and his kids especially his daughter and how far a man is willing to travel to ensure their safety, add to that the adventure of exploration and the sci fi of the unknown and you have a new genre. I'm going to call it ""Sciloveture"" Matthew McConaughey is once again brilliant he is really living up to his reputation of being a very fine actor, as well as his on screen younger daughter Mackezie Fox who almost steals the film from him. To be honest all the characters were likable and very believable. It's a film filled with space, science and the unknown. Please don't let that deter you from seeing this on the big screen though, as I said earlier I'm in no way smart enough to understand exactly what was being said but I guess that's what makes this film work so well I didn't need to, it all made perfect sense with everything else that happens along the way. Be sure to watch out for the droid like sidekicks as well, they bring the smiles. It has some very draw dropping moments that even put M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, The Village) to shame. Nolan has an amazing flair and talent he brings this story to live no matter what the naysayers think. Go see it although I would leave the kids behind because it does run for about 3 hours. 3 hours that flew by for me anyway, I didn't even notice the time I was that enthralled by the Nolan's world.",Interstellar

672,i_ianchev,Interstellar feels sorry,9/10,9 November 2014,"This movie is so eloquently presenting us with our current problems that we have to be blind to miss the chance to change our main goals as species...It seems that one has to eat a lot of corn to be able to produce such a concept as Interstellar. Or am I wrong? :) This sci-fi movie is dedicated to our eternal struggle to reach and research, to conquer and obtain. It strives to reach for Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but somewhere near the end of its run it lands below it. At the end of its 169-minute runtime one feels relieved that he has endured this emotional and transcending journey into space-time, gravity and physics. So much information and ideas float throughout this movie that we feel incomprehensibly lacking intelligence at some moments. That is because Mr. Nolan is giving us too much information in too short time. That being said - the film is incredible and beautiful. And even more - practically a direct message to our hearts that it is up to us to decide what to do - concentrate on saving our planet and our species or on what we do best - survive no matter what. The constellation of actors is incredible - McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, Damon, Chastain, Affleck - we see almost the best cast which one director can assemble these years. And they play very well. The viewer can feel and succumb into their emotions - fear, despair, happiness, hope and so on. The camera perfectly follows the circular journey of our main character (conqueror) Coop'. The special effects and the music are GIGANTIC. Hans Zimmer is truly offering us the feel of depth and infinity.The drought and famine which are the problem of the future's Earth are our problem right now too. Climatic changes are bringing us to the same problems which are presented in the movie as a certain reason of our species demise. That is why this film is so necessary at this point of our development as a modern society. That is why I liked very much the way Mr. Nolan has expressed his views in this movie.Also, please keep in mind that there are some VERY emotional and controversial scenes of confrontation between McConaughey and Hathaway, between McConaughey and Damon. There are some peaks of emotional strain which can offer you not only very good acting lessons, but also a perfect dissection of our human nature. This is what I liked best in this movie. And also - of course the topics about family relationships and love. It is very important that we always remember and understand that we as humans need to share with each other, to help and to remember each other. The the only gravity which transcends beyond time and connects us eternally is LOVE.",Interstellar
673,vav-61764,Interstellar is Definitely Worth Watching Thanks to Its Stunning Visual Effects and Thought-Provoking Story,10/10,4 July 2015,"Interstellar is surely in my TOP-3 Movies, I'm fascinated by the space and watching a movie so well-done was a mind-blowing. Firstly, it isn't just another space movie to see incredible screens of the space, this one is very critical, showing what our current society, our way of life, can cause in the world. The Earth is loosing its capacity of supporting life due to our actions in the past. The whole cast did an excellent performance to create and develop the characters, but the younger Murph(Mackenzie Foy) and Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) stand out. The scenes, where they both were in it or just one of them, are marvelous. They really managed to transmit the emotions each scene required and you certainly feel emotional in some of them.A physicist, Kip Thorne, was called to help the film to be the most realistic possible. The scenes where the space was being portrayed, the CGI used in it was superb, they seemed so real, that I felt like I was looking through a mirror. The numbers of Special Effects's awards won by this movie is a way to notice how good the CGI was. Another feature to be recognizable is the soundtrack done by Hans Zimmer. The actions scenes, the nail-biting and teeth shaking scenes acquired so much depth with the soundtrack, it was like I was in it, feeling the fear, the hopelessness, the emotions which the characters were having.In the end, Interstellar is a memorable movie, which both cast and the crew successfully created a well-crafted film. The message that it wants to transmit is really thought-provoking and inspiring.",Interstellar

676,Deathstryke,"Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece",7/10,10 November 2014,"""Interstellar"" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, ""Gravity"", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.",Interstellar

A one shot to risk your own life for the world.....but you realize later, it's not your life you are risking...its your own children. And its your children who were risking their life to save yours.I don't want to reveal the entire film but I can't stop thinking of this film.

This isn't just the best sci-fi film I've ever seen, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an incredibly powerful, beautiful film about humanity (as are the vast majority of sci-fi films). Not only does it stand repeat viewing, it gets better each time I watch it. It's perfect filmmaking.

679,jmoney-2,Love Transcends All Space & Time,8/10,14 November 2014,"The Nolans (director Chris and co-writer Jonathan), treat us to one of the grandest space adventures we've seen in awhile. It's the kind of adventure you go to the movies to see, an adventure filled with some truly heart-pounding sequences which further cement Chris Nolan's reputation as a great action director. He makes full use of the IMAX format, not only visually but audibly, too. The supersized frame and booming sound mix create an immersive experience.Nolan also deftly navigates his actors through several exposition-heavy scenes that would have otherwise threatened to drag down the film. In addition, he and his brother came up with some very clever ways to visualize some very complicated theories of physics, theories that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Some may complain about the movie's pacing. It weighs in with a robust running time of 169 minutes. But as I was watching it, I was in no rush for the movie to end. While Interstellar may be too derivative to be truly great, it's still quite a ride.The film takes its inspiration from many sources. There are doses of everything from The Right Stuff to both Star Trek (exploring strange new worlds) and Star Wars (helpful droids, icy planets). But there is no doubt that 2001 is the model. Its influences are seen in everything from the slow, majestic shots of heavenly bodies, to Hans Zimmer's haunting music cues. At times, it almost seems like the Nolans decided to have their characters drop in to visit each of the worlds glimpsed in Odyssey's famously trippy ""star gate"" sequence. The aspect where the movie most resembles Kubrick's is its insistence on respecting the laws of physics and treating space travel realistically. This is the rare space-based story that not only acknowledges the Theory of Relativity, but also uses it as a serious obstacle. As the crew of Cooper's ship speeds away from Earth, time starts moving more slowly for them. As they approach a black hole, the time dilation becomes even greater. Over the course of what seems like just hours to the astronauts, decades pass back on Earth. (That is not to say there are no nits to pick in the plausibility department. A healthy suspension of disbelief is still required.)Where 2001 and Interstellar depart are their themes and points of view. Kubrick takes a cynical, detached view of humanity. He observes the characters in his space odyssey as if they were rats in a maze. The Nolans' film is far more empathetic and emotionally driven. While 2001 was about a big idea – the search for our creator and an understanding of our place in the universe – Interstellar is about something much smaller and more basic: The love between a parent and a child.The movie's central relationship is between Cooper and his daughter, Murphy (she's played by Mackenzie Foy as a child and by Jessica Chastain as an adult - and the two actresses bear a remarkable resemblance to each other). She is the reason Cooper embarks on the journey and she is the reason he is determined to find his way home. The movie postulates that love is a force as powerful as gravity, a force that can endure unimaginable distances and infinite stretches of time, and a force that can't be defined by a simple equation.There won't be many dry eyes in the house as the movie comes to its conclusion. That's thanks to an excellent stable of actors who allow the movie's emotions to resonate and the audience to become invested. McConaughey's everyman persona is exactly what his character required. And he's not the only Oscar winner in the cast. In fact, a past Academy Award winner (including one you won't see in the trailers) fills out just about every other major role in the film.The only thing Interstellar reveres more than science and exploration -- is humanity. Like all great art, it is a commentary on life. It shows us that when it comes to saving our species, the only superior beings we need to look to are ourselves. And when it comes to unraveling the mysteries of our place in the universe, we need only to look inside the human heart.",Interstellar
680,like_cc,persevere faith,9/10,1 April 2020,"Persevere faith, career loyalty!
We are often not the genius of one ten millionth, and we explore on the road of life. In addition to courage and intelligence, perhaps more importantly, persistence and loyalty. Because there will always be a day when you will be disappointed by the flatness of life, you will lose confidence in your prospects, and even hate and hate all those who give you the role of life today, especially yourself!
We always inferiority and want to renounce ourselves. From nowhere to be able to pass, we blindly believe in deceiving and letting us choose to obey.
All of this, maybe only persistence and loyalty can give us the last hope.

681,sedativchunk,"The ""Titanic"" of sci fi, and the best of it's kind, period.",10/10,10 April 2015,"I have seen Interstellar twice now. Once in IMAX on the big screen and now at home on blu ray in my home theater. Let me begin by saying I am a huge science fiction fanatic. I've watched everything over the years from the typical Star Trek and Star Wars films to the classics such as 2001, 2010, Forbidden Planet, the Terminator, both versions of the Day the Earth Stood Still, the ""Alien"" franchise and many more including old B list movies such as ""The First Spaceship on Venus"". So I know science fiction. Strong above all, I consider Interstellar the best science fiction film ever made, period. If not, one of the top 10 best films made in the history of cinema. Great acting, great storyline, great visuals, captivating soundtrack, and overall just a solid film. Interstellar is the pinnacle of great filmmaking. This movie is truly a masterpiece from beginning to end. It only gets better when you rewatch it a second time, and unlike some films that are just eye candy in the theatre, this film looks and sounds great from the comfort of your home. The space scenes are brilliantly done and the alien landscapes are truly captivating. I simply don't know how to put it into words. Matthew McConaughey blew this one out of the water and then some, as well as the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job with this film. There is simply nothing I can think of to say badly about this film. Whether you like science fiction movies or not, you should not pass up on watching Interstellar. This film is an epic masterpiece. Anyone bashing the science aspects of the film, plot, or other details are simply hating on this film because it is so good. And that's coming from someone with a college background in science and astronomy outside of my love for science fiction. This movie is not scientifically accurate 100% of the time, but it is easily overlooked at the general quality of the film itself. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Whether you like space flicks or not, this is a fantastic movie inside and out. I would rate it higher than a 10 if I could.",Interstellar
682,dreamdemon-1,Possibly the best movie of the year,9/10,11 November 2014,"In today's world it's really difficult to make a cool movie about space. With knowledge one click away (I'm not going to argue quality, just availability), people are more and more critical of movie tropes and with popular scientists gaining momentum, you can't get away anymore with something like Armageddon for example.Interstellar plays its cards very well, with a producer being himself a scientists and also with the fact that with very few exceptions it deals a lot with research that's mainly theoretical (wormholes, their gravity and what happens to known dimensions inside an event's horizon). Ground in firm research, but still theoretical.Nolan's genius manages to transpose the theory into a visually compelling story that is gripping from the start and takes you all the way without becoming confusing and sometimes spelling out things for those less science-oriented. It's nearly perfect.I say nearly because like with every movie that plays on wits, sometimes it loses itself in details that expose the limitations of the writers. Examples:the title characters is the best pilot they had, yet instead of making him a part of the project from the start (maybe even train others), the gets on board what seems as chance (yes, we are told that in fact he's the one that loops around in time and gets himself on track)for a guy that gets trapped for a moment in the tesseract allowing him to swim across time he 1) fails to see the good that comes of his endeavor and 2) he starts the sequence of events, then tries to stop it and then sets on track again, like a brief stint of schizophrenia for some reason.Brand's speech about love is so out of place in the spaceship, so out of time and out of tune with the movie that it doesn't go beyond a WTF moment. Why in the world would a scientist trained to save mankind do that? Even Romilly who supposedly spent 23 years in complete silence and solitude is able to basically shrug it off and focus, but Brand breaks down in sentimentalism for no apparent reasonthe movie's premise is compelling because it's firmly grounded in reality: mankind will run out of food in less than 100 years. Yet aside from environmental changes that speak on a greater scale, there's nothing showing the effect on people's lives. Yes, their meals aren't the lavish ones Hollywood movies usually depict, but they're not poor either. Nothing speaks about the urgency of not wasting food, for example, or of all the hungry people that surely must be out there. Perhaps some wars over food? But there's nothing.I would definitely love to see an extended version with more detail.",Interstellar
683,tinyfordst,The best film I've ever seen,10/10,19 January 2016,"To start this off I would like to point out that if you love scientific accuracy you will definitely love this film! Okay given that some of the math is definitely out concerning time, the rest is all completely correct IN THEORY. This is where the film impressed me. There are not many sci-fi titles that actually use realistic science anymore. Everything turned to sensation and stretching imagination. Not this one. It stretched science's imagination!!The CGI in this film was so next level I could see why the budget was so intense. As always Hans Zimmer did what is expected of him, and created a soundtrack for the film that made the viewer feel like you were completely there and inside the same situations. If this film is the start of a new sci-fi generation, then this would be the best start in cinematic history.

684,vincent-27,Good Directors do not (necessarily) make good writers,1/10,31 December 2018,"Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about.",Interstellar
685,redeyedtree,Outstanding,9/10,9 November 2014,"Interstellar fell short of a 10 because the voices in some parts were too low, I simply could not hear what they were saying. In fact, we missed at least half of Professor Brand's (Caine) dying confession. Fortunately Murph (a brilliant Chastain) filled in most of those blanks. My other issue was with the scenes around the black hole and Cooper (McConaughey) awakening at the hospital. Those scenes were unnecessarily complicated and it was compounded by more muffled dialogue. Most of the movie addressed the science - factual and fictional - in a more understandable way and spread the harder concepts out. I loved everything else. All the actors stepped up. Standing with Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were Matthew McConaughey, Ann Hathaway, John Lithgow, Matt Damon and Mackenzie Foy as young Murph. Matthew McConaughey is no longer just a hot guy doing his thing, he is a dad struggling to give his children a life and a future. He doesn't always make the right decisions but he's doing the best he can. Fortunately he has his weathered father-in-law (Lithgow) to raise his children while he goes off to save the world. Foy masterfully captures the emotions of the young daughter who so completely loves her dad and feels utterly betrayed by his decision to leave. Early on Brand (Hathaway) breaks down and I resented the 'hysterically emotional woman' implications of that. When I stepped back, though, I realized that unlike Cooper her whole life has been about the success of this one mission. She abruptly learns that a lifetime of planning and a lifetime of personal sacrifices does not guarantee success. Dr Mann (Damon) faces similar realities but allows it to blacken his heart. Damon perfectly plays the obsessed man. Interstellar is a thrill ride that I hope to go on again and again.",Interstellar
686,alexsnower,2001: The rip off,7/10,12 July 2021,"This is a decent movie but again heavily overrated. Higher than 2001? The movie it practically ripped off. Higher than Citizen Kane? Are you kidding me? The film is fine. Besides saying ""Murph"", Matthew McConaughey does decent. Michael Caine is just here to explain things like in every Nolan movie and Matt Damon is pointless in this movie. It's a good movie but cmon 8.6?

Sound and visuals were truly awesome! During the rocket scenes, really felt like we were flying through space. Movie wasn't perfect (very few are perfect), but very very good. Couple of strange plot points, and a few moments in the movie that didn't work as well as they could have, but really stunning and a really exciting ride.Go see and experience it on the big screen!

I'll start by saying what I didn't like. The ending was dreadful, almost as if the writers were in a rush to finish. I can imagine the conversation, ""I can't be bothered anymore, how can we wrap this up?"" someone says ""Kubrick got away with it"" and so a meaningless crappy ending similar to, but worse than, ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" was shoved in. The ending, quite simply, was drivel and unsatisfying. Secondly, a world devastated by drought and famine, somehow manages to run a sophisticated space programme, in secret. This would really require materials and technology that could only be supplied by prosperous technological civilisation. Actors spouting pseudo-scientific BS and waffle , it's not necessary and just ruins the movie. Star Wars gets it right, the technology just IS and we can enjoy the CGI. I loved the scene where they are on a planet subject to strong tidal gravitation. In summary, a mish-mash of good and bad ideas tipped into a bucket and stirred. Another wasted opportunity.

It was mentioned many times by Professor Brand in the film. This is not only a summary of his decades of trying to solve the equation about the destiny of the entire human race, but also his unwillingness to withdraw and accept the fact of his failure at this time. Helpless, it is his hope for the future of mankind.Interstellar is a movie that is very worthy of digging. Here I will explain it into the following points1 backgroundThe background shown in the film should be in the near future. At that time, due to the environmental crisis, a large number of plants were afflicted with blight, so that people's basic needs could not be guaranteed. As the film said: At that time, everyone It is a farmer.Due to the pressure of society, aerospace industry and education can only give way to people's basic survival needs. However, this involves a very interesting topic: to save mankind from the current predicament, only to put the line of sight into space again, and the public does not care. At this point, all we care about is the basic need for food and clothing. This is a set of contradictions that are very difficult to resolve. 2 SurvivalWhether it is for people on earth or for Dr. Mann, what the people do is the instinct of human beings as living things: survivalHowever, after all, human beings will not wait to die, so scientists launched the ""Lazarus Project"", which is to send 12 scientists to a certain planet to detect whether the planet meets the basic conditions for human existence. However, waiting for these pioneers or embarking on the journey alone, this is also related to the lies of Dr. Mann behind.Lazarus is a character recorded in the ""Gospel of John in the Bible."" When he was critically ill, he died before Jesus was cured, but Jesus concluded that he would be resurrected. Four days later, Lazarus walked out of the cave. Prove the miracle of Jesus.3 Single-choice questions given to humans by plans A and BTwo plans proposed by Dr. BrandA: Find out a way to crack the gravity formula and save the humans on the earth. This is also the reason that Cooper left his daughter and embarked on the task of saving mankind. For him, it was to open up the future for his children.B: Abandon humans on Earth, open up alien colonies, and bring human fertilized eggs, so that the human race will not be extinct. However, this seemingly cold plan B has become Bran before Cooper leaves. Dr. De's only answer to this question is that the astronauts and people on Earth don't know it.
4 Love and connection ghost (ghost)For the last human beings, it is not the so-called plan that really allows us to get out of the predicament, but ""love and connection"" is embodied in the film as the connection between daughter Murphy and father Cooper (the watch for daughter).
There is also the ghost that has always existed with Murphy. It is this ghost that guided Murphy and Cooper to NASA and solved the gravitational formula to create the future for mankind. Behind all this is the incomprehensible five. Humans in three-dimensional space.After having a child, parents will become ghosts of the child's futureIncluding Dr. Brand's belief in his loverThis is the answer Nolan gave us: love5 Murphy's TheoremMurphy's Law: If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of the choices will lead to disaster, someone must make this choice. The basic content is: if something has the possibility of going bad, no matter how small the possibility is, it will always happen. ToHowever, Murphy's Theorem does not necessarily refer to the occurrence of bad things. This is why Cooper named his daughter Murphy. It is her small probability event that saved all mankind.
6 Science involved in the filmI am a liberal arts student, so naturally I don't give too much guidance on the scientific theories in the film, but it's okay to mention it.Morse code binary five-dimensional space black holeOf course, in order to satisfy hardcore movie fans, Nolan specially invited scientist Kipthorne to interpret the science in the film ""Science in Interstellar Transition""7 About timeThe watch Cooper gave his daughter when he left. Cooper said that maybe we will be the same age when I come back. However, because of the time difference caused by gravity, 23 years later when Cooper and his daughter are the same age, he still doesn't. Come back, and at the end, time is no longer important, because love is eternal8 The display of five-dimensional space and the special effects of the filmFor us three-dimensional creatures, time seems to be a hurdle that is difficult to cross, and it is difficult for us to break through it. However, for human beings in five-dimensional space, time can be represented concretely, just as for them, it is just from one mountain to another. Just sit on the mountain. The film also shows gorgeous and dreamy time in five-dimensional space9 Hans Zimmer's musicI always think that what distinguishes a work from being excellent or real is music that leaves a mark in my heart. I clearly remember the music played when Cooper and his children drove across the cornfield to chase the drone at the beginning of the film: ""Cornfield Chase"" was my heart being gradually ignited and immersed in the film.And when Cooper docked the spaceship, ""No Time for cautiou"" also gave me a real appreciation for the role of the soundtrack. And my admiration for Hans Zimmer. The mutual achievement between him and Nolan will inevitably become a film and television story. spread
10 EndingAt the end of the film, Cooper reunited with the elderly Murphy. Although it was many years away from what they had expected, the father still fulfilled his promise of his daughter.And Dr. Brand has once again embarked on the path of explorationShe is still in space, building a camp, alone in a strange galaxy, maybe she is about to sleep for a long time, bathed in the light of the new sun, in our new homePersonally, I should not cry more than five times in my movie-watching career in the past few years, and when I watched interstellar, I shed tears with music three times. This is still the Nolan I love. Six years later, on August 2, 2020, it touched me again and exuded the unique charm of the movie.
At the end, I will share with you my favorite line again as usualLove is an eternal force, capable of transcending all dimensions. When I return, you are already dying, and I have passed your whole life with one breath.",Interstellar

694,Westeire,Just the music alone makes it great.,10/10,10 November 2014,"The Hans Zimmer music is spectacular in this movie. Without a doubt this will be a classic movie for years and years. Not going to ruin the story, its science fiction. there is not an over use of CGI. I thought it was better than inception, which I also liked. Both movies had a play on the perception of time, other worlds. Unlike inception, this movie had a strong tug at the heart with a lot of emotion. The very fact so many people are talking about this movie will make you want to go and see it. Also its really a movie you have to watch on the big screen. Its well done. the nearly 3 hours was good, it did it justice. f

695,milleymeister,Sci fi good but not mind blowing,8/10,9 November 2020,"I watched this before and have just rewatched it. I saw the title somewhere and couldn't remember if I had watched it before. As I watched it, it started to come back. I don't know if it is because I have read some great scifi but this one wasn't particularly super wonderful. In reading wonderful sci fi, I get the benefit of a certain amount of description of the fabulous plot, world building, creatures, characters etc. My mind does the visualizations. And I prefer it that way. It is part of the enjoyment that is appealing about scifi: we have to use our imaginations. (This is similar for me with music videos: when they first came out I hated them as I had no interest in someone else's interpretation visually of the music - even if it was the writer of the music themselves. ) With the moviemakers they have to do that visualization for us. I liked the premise of this movie. It got stretched a little thin probably due to the limitations on the length of the movie itself. But the premise and the story weren't better and I mean as good as many books I have enjoyed. Did they do a fab job turning a story and premise like this into a movie. OH MY GOD YES! but its a high bar to jump over the movies in my head when I read a superlative sci fi book.It is telling that I didn't remember if I had seen this. But an enjoyable 2.5 hours.",Interstellar
696,MoviesRT,"Makes ""Lost in Space"" look like a masterpiece.",1/10,12 November 2014,"My goodness, where do we start?First of all, the many 10's this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3-yr-old.Nolan must know nothing about real science. He bandies ""worm-holes"" and ""anomolies"" around like he really knows what they are.Had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all.Just shows that putting big Hollywood stars in a movie doesn't guarantee a good product in the end.I won't go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned, but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60's show ""Lost in Space."" Will Robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie.The biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on, yet they didn't even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all. His kids are grown, but they still live in the same run down house and Michael Caine, who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back. And the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same. Still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested.Every time they tried to say something intelligent, the audience laughed. No one in the theater took this movie seriously at all.Sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science.Bottom line: This was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors. What a waste!!",Interstellar
697,jan_kalina,"""Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. """,10/10,8 November 2014,"Nor should the audience be drowned in mediocrity of today's cinema. Some filmmakers seriously lack any ambition. Ambitious is the first word that pops up in my head while describing Interstellar. Christopher Nolan is the most ambitious director working right now. He's on a completely different level. His films are intelligent, thought provoking but still infinitely amusing, fun and re-watchable. And foremost his films are always a spectacle.Interstellar is at its core a story about the father/daughter relationship when the Earth is slowly and surely becoming an inhabitable place. Plagued by frequent dust storms, the crops can no longer sustain mankind. In secret a plan is hatched to find a planet in a different galaxy, which would meet the demands for sustainable future of mankind. Cooper, a former engineer now turned farmer, is mysteriously drawn to join this expedition, an expedition for which he was his whole life. Facing many obstacles the most important is the simplest one. Will he ever see her daughter again, and save her and the mankind? From this very brief plot summary and when you will watch the film, you will be surprised ho emotional the film is. Important is that all these emotions, every event, every obstacle, every grace and beauty and danger these characters encounter, you will feel with them. That is how this film will pull you in, absorb you.Matthew McConaughey gives a stellar performance (pun intended). Since he has turned his career he became a great actor but I was getting tired of his one key characters. But in Interstellar he gives a marvelous performance where you feel all the pain his character feels. Biggest surprise is once again the child actress in a similar way it happened in Spielberg's War of the Worlds. Mackenzie Foy as Murph is just simply put magnificent. She is even better than her older version played by Jessica Chastain who is also amazing. Michael Caine is Nolan's lucky charm, whenever he is in his film you can bet it won't disappoint. Matt Damon was a public secret. All I will tell you is that he is a very important character. Anne Hathaway's stubborn professor might be a little unconvincing to some but she certainly fits the part. In other words Nolan always know who to cast in his films.What is the most mesmerising is the music. Hans Zimmer has simply outdone himself once again. The score is chilling, emotional and as many other aspects of the films in some moments little reminiscent of 2001: Space Odyssey. In no way can I stretch enough how different this sounds from previous Zimmer's scores.It's the music which you will want to hear again immediately after leaving the cinema.As Nolan has stated he made a film which you don't experience through characters, you experience it along with them. Seeing this film in IMAX definitely helps. It's an incredible movie-going experience, one you will regret for a long time if you miss it on the big screen. It's a refreshingly ambitious film with story to tell made with the right tools, told on a massive scale. And it was incredible. Undescribable.Interstellar is Nolan's message about the importance of science, the experience of parenthood, human curiosity and the beauty of exploring which comes from it, the will to survive, the nature of humanity and the value of love. It is a film which fills you with hope and curiosity. You will certainly look up to the sky with wonder as we have used to.P.S. I didn't experience any issues with sound, as reported on some film sites, so I guess if you want to see this film in the right way go to the IMAX in Prague. I have heard every line of dialogue and every note in the score.",Interstellar
698,arminhage,Capitalizing on people's crave for stupidity,2/10,23 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan is either stupid or takes advantage of people's crave for stupidity. The movie was so bad that I don't know where to begin.1. In the beginning of the movie we have a world with frequent sandstorms (or lets say that we see an state in US Midwest). Apparently there is no army anymore, we do not know what year is it exactly, we do not know what has happened to earth, We do not know Cooper's background. We never get any answers but some very vague clues... A clever director could skillfully embed the answers in the screenplay and make the movie more pleasant and engaging. The whole idea is that the climate on parts of earth may escalate to the down side but it can not affect the whole planet which most of its surface is covered with water and even based on what we saw in the movie, the planet was not in such a bad condition to summon extreme measures like leaving it.2. Cooper is an ex something who is farmer now. Based on strange phenomenon in his daughter's room, he discovers a coordinate. He jumps in his truck and goes there to get arrested, to meet familiar people from his past and to get the job offer!!! Like there was no pilots and they were just making the spaceship without a pilot and now God sent them Cooper! At that moment that Professor Brand asked him to pilot the ship, I felt I was watching Alibaba and Forty thieves of Baghdad! It was that cheesy and unfortunately the cheesiness happened way early in the movie.3. We assume they made it into the wormhole in. After that in theory, all the communication with earth should cease as no means of wireless communication can follow them into the wormhole. Granted that they emerged out of the wormhole somewhere else in this physical world but it can be millions of light years away from earth. Nothing can travels faster than light, if you are millions of light years away, or even hundreds of light years away, that simply means that you will not get any signal from earth in your lifetime even if 1 minute of your time is a year o earth. It just doesn't make sense. I think they tried to described how they communicate but it was so stupid that I can't even remember.4. In the beginning of the journey, a huge 3 stages rocket launched the spaceship into earth's orbit but later on, they land on a planet with gravity 1.5 times stronger than earth and they manage to get off the planet without the rocket???5. The robot was probably the most stupid. Actually it was so bad that they never really showed any details. The way it was laying in the spaceship reminded me of R2-D2 in star wars but R2-DD2 was making sense... this one? it reminded me of Spongebob at best!6. They keep talking about starting a human colony by cloning human genes. No one is talking about plant seeds or animal genes as apparently the humans in such colony are supposed to eat rock and sand!7. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST! THE PLAN A!!!!!!!! Oh my God, this is where i got offended. Plan A means relocating billions of people from earth to a distant planet. Apparently the professor knew it was bullshit but if Cooper was not smart enough to slap him in face for saying such nonsense, I do not know who would trust hims to pilot a spaceship?Nolan tried hard to recreate something like the Space Odyssey 2001 but the closest he got was the music of the movie! Worth watching but very stupid and forgettable.",Interstellar
699,thedukeofmovietown,Science fact meets science theory meets science fiction,7/10,31 October 2016,"Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.I really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, ""we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?"" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.Overall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.",Interstellar
700,pjbhaumik,Apocalypse Forces Innovation,9/10,24 April 2016,Interstellar was a science fiction movie for the space exploration enthusiasts. Anne Hathaway was a strong and smart female character. A stunningly attractive and successful female scientist in the growingly coed profession is still hard to find from the industrial sector. The quality of science behind the film's mechanisms for deep space travel and travel through a black hole appeared inadequate. There was physics illustrated in the movie through conceptually revolutionary scenes in a wormhole yet the spaceships looked contemporary. Modern NASA and private space exploration companies put the same kind of technology into space today. The movie illustrated this real disparity between the depths of science and the capacity of technology!,Interstellar

704,judemcrobbie,Incredible!!!,10/10,5 February 2021,"I hesitate to put a movie here, but this really is up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first two Star wars for space movies.This contains Spoilers so please don't read this if you haven't watched it already you are only depriving yourself. Also minor spoilers for The Dark Knight (2008).The score is chilling. Hans Zimmer creates the environment perfectly and resonates each scene so well.
The movie is genuinely gorgeous. The best looking movie I think I've ever seen (either this or blade runner 2049). All the CGI fits in seamlessly and what isn't CGI is so beautifully shot, creating the beauty of our insignificance. The lighting makes the movie stand out from any other good looking movie, aesthetically. And the creativity of those camera angles are amazing. The static IMAX shot from the corner of a ship or on the shoulder of a person shot is one of the most creative ever. It presents the ideal of the world moving around the protagonists and how their mission is vital so they must not take in the environment and be single minded etc.
Matthew McConaughey's acting is special. He creates the character and THAT scene gets me every time. He delivers the caring father mentality so well that when he has to leave them, it feels like you're leaving your own children.
It is an impossibly hard concept to grasp, obviously meaning-especially considering its Nolan-that there's going to be a ton of exposition. I do not mind exposition, but for someone who gets bored easily this could be a problem. It is necessary as the concept is a tough one, however it is not done particularly well. It is quite annoying though as it makes Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) seem dumber as he has to ask questions in space, where he definitely would have been briefed on earth, just so the viewer gets to know.
The theme of love transcending space and time, albeit cheesy, is presented beautifully, especially from the performances of Matthew McConaughey (Cooper), Anne Hathaway (Brand) and Jessica Chastain (Murph).
Another Problem with Christopher Nolan, for me at least, is his choice of sound mixing. I really enjoy some of it, especially the one about how there's no sound in space which is reflected through the music. however crucial bits of dialogue are sometimes mixed so terribly that the lines are completely unintelligible. Again this is sometimes good, as it helps understand the magnitude of the sound and situation they're surrounded in but at other times it is very annoying.
Dr Mann's (Matt Damon) character is one of the most interesting, probably the most interesting in the movie. Nolan definitely had The Dark Knight (2008) in mind when writing for this character. In essence, Dr Mann embodies the idea of absurdism, or the concept of what happens to someone when confronted by the absurd. This is the idea that anyone, no matter how good they are at heart, can have one bad day and become truly evil. As alluded to, this is shown in The Dark Knight. The Joker forces the people of Gotham to face the absurd through his actions in the final act and the Coleman Rhys scene: The people in each boat facing the absurd in the chance to blow themselves, or the other boat up. And choosing to kill Coleman Rhys or let the Joker blow up a hospital. These are examples of confronting the absurd as its the choice between two losing situations, the one bad day. This is doubly so as we see Harvey Dent, 'The White Knight' the best of us too. And the Joker subjects him to his one bad day and despite being this incorruptible figure, a force for good, the joker shows anyone can fall even Harvey Dent. In The Dark Knight this idea is to show chaos in The Dark Knight, here its trying to show the themes of Nature vs Nurture and how without love a man can turn to the worst version of himself.
(The Dark Knight talk over)
The final act of the movie is one of my favourites. the deliberate ambiguity really sticks in your mind for days. It also wraps up the movie perfectly and its really got that 'Ahhh' factor that few movies manage to do. This is through everyone's arc wrapping up perfectly:
Cooper-Who was struggling to reconcile with the idea of never seeing his kids again the whole way through the movie (It being his main driving force), realises he must give up his life and ambition in the aid of humanity.
Brand-Whose love with Edmunds is her driving force. This is to get back to him (There's that transcendent nature of love again) however she loses another love, not romantically but a Philia love (Friendship love), in cooper sacrificing himself for her.
Murph-One of the main reasons for her development is due to the resentment from her dad. The final act wraps it up for her as not only does she solve an equation that has already been through one person, but also the majority of her life, she also learns to love her dad again despite him being millions of light years away (There it is again).This movie works so well as the theme, plot and characters have complete unity and harmony with each other.",Interstellar

The Hobbit which was an extremely thin book is a three part movie. Let's now even begin with comic book overkill.But this movie stands heads over everything Hollywood has produced in the last few years. The movie is a long stretch at 3 hours, but it is an incredibly good 3 hours.What sets this movie apart is its originality, and classic SciFi basis. In the past SciFi has been altered to include Fantasy aspects, but not this movie. The acting was superb, and while I could go on and on, it boils down to one thing. If you like a good SciFi movie you will like this movie.

707,diomavro,One of Nolan's best.,8/10,18 November 2014,"This movie was one that was totally under the radar for me and honestly I didn't think Nolan would be the one to make a good space movie. Characters: This is likely the weakest link of the movie. Probably the weakest character in my view is Matthew McConaughey, I don't know if he does it on purpose or not but his usual oddball accent is here, its sometimes fun and sometimes it kills me to try and decipher what he is saying into English, and when you parallel this with physics talk at some point its like playing acrobatic board games with drunk people. Apart from the acting his character mostly seems to be static with barely any character progression, mostly just moving through scenery. Nolan was never really the best at making dynamic characters, even Murph just seems to only get a bit smarter without really changing her approach to life in any way(her brother neither). Plot: I thought the story was well paced and engrossing. I was convinced as to why things were progressing as they did, the situation on earth did seem rather dire, though space being the only solution did seem a bit odd and it wasn't explained why alternatives were not viable. Once in space the movie does a great job of balancing the sound to reflect the emptiness of space with the drama that is associated with the mission. Cinematography: I have nothing bad to say about this, I thought the camera work was perfect to capture the scale and the insignificance of human beings in the universe. The planets were well done and the shots down on earth were good fun. Special category, physics: Most of the physics in this movie were accurate though perhaps for non-physics nerds there was a lot left untold about how relativity works. A few nit-pickings, we might not know exactly what happens when you go into a black hole but before you ever get deep into one, you will be collapse into yourself as the force is much more powerful than any organic being can survive, indeed the whole jet-packing out of the black hole is probably not possible. The first planet they went to had very shallow water or at least very strong gravity, either of which would indicate that tsunami's are highly unlikely. Probably the biggest made up aspect is the dimension(going into a 5d world) trip, especially coming out of it as his normal self in the end. Last but not least on the physics front I don't think wormholes exist in anything but concept so perhaps a little more light shedding on why it was there and a bit more excitement in what it could mean would have been nice. Overall a must watch for the sci-fi dudes/gals out there though this is quite a different breed than the space films before it.",Interstellar
708,TheReviewMaster,Stellar: Another Nolan Treat,9/10,2 May 2015,"I like to keep my reviews simple and spoiler free, and with films like Interstellar it truly is best to watch without an iota of a spoiler. Nolan has just performed another Inception (at least into my mind, and I hope into every other mind who spends well-earned time with the Nolan's), bringing advanced scientific theory into the mainstream via the Hollywood Blockbuster. Nolan is making smart movies, and not treating audiences like idiots, which is what every director and producer needs to start doing a bit more of.Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderful. Matt shows great acting range. There are a lot of tearful moments where I just couldn't tear myself from the screen. The sound design had a refreshing change in style.Now If you'll excuse me, I need to go brush up on my Quantum Mechanics.

710,thatfilmperson,It's about all of us.,10/10,6 February 2018,"My absolute favorite. It's a pretty difficult movie to talk about, because at first people perceive it as another one of these ""Space Sci-fi stuff"", but oh boy it is so much more... *It's a movie about impossible decisions and situations and how different people face them.*MINOR SPOILER
(Can and should a single human being always think about the common good? What if saving humanity demands sacrificing your own life? A life of a love one? A life of a child?)*It's a movie about human relationships that were never put to a test in such a unique way.*It's a movie about intolerable cowardice and reckless bravery. (No Time for Caution!)*It's a movie about all of us, trying to have it all.*It's a movie about the most hilarious and the most likable rectangles of metal with 90% honesty setting...*It's a movie about permanence and consistency of love. (It is being pictured as a ""Fifth Dimension"", which I don't necessarily like, but it's worth mentioning)*And finally, it's another one of these ""Space Sci-fi stuff""
But boy, it is so much more...P.S. Matthew McConaughey's was, imo, perfect for this role. His overall vibe lets us perceive him as ""one of us"", unlike other schmart people in the space program. 
(MURPH) P.S.S. Hans Zimmer is a genius, I want to have his babies. Watched that movie in 2014, still find myself falling asleep to the tunes of ""Stay"", letting myself go to ""Detach"" and jamming to ""No Time for Caution"".I'm a fan of Oscars and I will forever be in a state of endless sorrow about this movie not being even nominated for Best Picture. (I mean ""Gravity"" gets nominated the year before, cmon now).",Interstellar
711,seshasai-tris,Interstellar = occurring or situated between stars,9/10,8 November 2014,"The movie deserves to stay on top of the other space movies ever produced. It offers more that what you'd expect from Chris Nolan.Back-ground Score: Hans Zimmer does it again for Nolan. The music is building up and manages to control your hear beat and moist in your palm and eyes. I won't spoil for you, but try to describe the music when Cooper leaves Murph and when the space ship enters the worm hole and during the end will make you deaf to bad music.Kind of Movie: Space Adventure. If you are looking for space action, this might not be the movie for you. The movie has action scenes, but it's not wound around it. The first one hour of the film is very thick and establishes a rock solid basement for the next 2 hours of super fast visual ride. Apart from the space visuals obtained from the ship-cam, the sound effects and music are just in a good pace.Positives: - Acting - Every actor gave their best shot. Mackenzie Foy (Young Murph) in the first one hour of film did an amazing job in building up the relation with Matthew ( Cooper).You don't wanna talk about the good acting skills of Mathhew, Jessica Chastain,Casey Affleck,Matt Damon and Michael Caine (who stars in all Nolan's films) - Visual effects - carefully knit around the story, beautifully projected on screen. ( 3 best scenes. Can't spoil ) - Background score - 10/10 to Hans Zimmer - Screenplay and editing make the film more paced, making 2 hour 45 minutes feel like an hour.Negatives - Michael Caina and Mathhew's dialogues at times are not clearlyaudible. - Anne Hathaway could be a better cat woman than Amelia. Her expressions in the space ship are funny.",Interstellar
712,bobcolganrac,Not All That Great,8/10,10 November 2014,"It was okay. I liked some parts better than some others. It didn't seem that believable. It really didn't make sense in the final analysis. It was a beautiful exercise in filmmaking----but plot-wise I thought it contrived, far-fetched, not that rational, too facile, and more like a good road trip movie that just happened to be somewhere outside the galaxy.Quite honestly I liked the movie, but I didn't love the movie. Once again, as in the film ""Gravity"" there were things that stretched credulity to the breaking point. Too many times things went wrong....and got salvaged somehow against all odds. I mean, making a swish jump shot from the other basket CAN be done-----but doing it FIVE times in the same game without missing even once? That's how ridiculous the survival of the two protagonist voyagers struck me. Example: Believable was Damon and his craft getting blown to hell------ Not-Believable was docking with the remnant of the ship....(which somehow survived all the shrapnel of the explosion), somehow docking with it as it spun at high speed, and somehow making it work. This sort of thing occurred repeatedly.If you want me to get caught up in scifi-----make it believable scifi. Give it enough possibility to allow me to suspend disbelief. That was not the case with this movie.Excellent acting. Fry, playing the daughter, is a beauty and a good actress. McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, Lithgow, Caine, etc all excellent in their roles. Great cinematography by Van Hoytema. Music by Hans Zimmer fit. Some of the planetary sets were absolutely wonderful, otherworldly indeed.Plot by the Nolans, though---- just not that credible.Overall, a good movie, and one with enough twists and spins to engage viewers into seeing it again in an attempt to make better sense of it, or to interpret it into something closer to the language called Logic.A beautiful movie, well crafted. . .lacking only credibility.",Interstellar
713,lothos-370-690020,Apollo 13 meets Armageddon,4/10,20 April 2015,"I judge this film a lot more harshly because I found the first half to be an interesting, well thought out and logical plot. Non of which can be said for the second half. It was like the writer got bored, said, OK that's enough, left the draft on his desk, and his six year old, finished it of in crayon. I can only assume the actors only read the the first half as there are some big names here.The second half falls apart by suffering a complete breakdown of logic and common sense. Early on the science makes sense, moves the plot along and works within the recognised parameters of the film universe. After they reach the other galaxy, I spent half the time face palming over the ridiculousness of the things these people were saying and doing. It was like I took drugs half way through, that's the only thing that explains my watching experience.Some fan is going to do a fan edit at some point, and then this film might be worth a second watch. At 2 hours 50 minutes, there's plenty of places to cut, which leads to another point. Despite the slow start and pace of the first half, it was the ridiculous unbelievable actions scenes towards the end, that were so out of touch with reality that I got bored and started clock watching.",Interstellar

Awe shucks. Those magic oil corporations must be making gas behind the scenes in this movie. Who made this heap of hubris propaganda? Hmm- given a choice... hmm - work with the planet you have or?

But ain't no corn in Iran. Well MAYBE. Human ancestors have records going back to 13,000 B.C. in Iran's Zagros mountains- I somehow think our ancestors were able to figure out how to grow MORE THAN CORN in a DESERT ENVIRONMENT - gee- you'd think we can too!.The only thing that could have made this movie worse was if Ben Affleck was in it - they probably just edited him out.I keep waiting for Malakye to show up from Children of the Corn, this could be a real treat if it goes that direction.Two Matts in one movie- REAL BAAAAYAD IDEA - both offer up the same generic - character - they always play. As for Matthew Mcconaughey? Even 25 years of rock solid alcohol and meth use won't help him forget this nightmare.This movie should have you wondering one thing - WHY ARE THEY DRIVING AROUND IN Co2 producing AUTOMOBILES - Why the American flag on McMcMc HOWEVER YOU SPELL THAT NAME - Matt brought more talent naked in front of bongos when he was arrested than in this production.Do yerself a favor- just go watch Children of the Corn I through XIII (You have to enumerate the first one, and last 3 yourself, but you get the idea) instead of this, THAT or put 2001 Space Odyssey on fast forward and overlay South Park's Wild Wild West song with Cartman singing:Well, I'm a badass Cowboy livin' in the Cowboy days.

715,raj040492,Einstein would have loved this,9/10,10 November 2014,"By the time you are reading this, there is a good chance that you have watched Interstellar. Hence, I will refrain from explaining the story-line and rather jump directly into the review itself.Christopher Nolan's tenth work on screen and his first work off earth is as big as the journey (taken by the crew in the movie) itself.That is only if you agree that $165,000,000 (the movie's budget) is actually a huge dough. Just like Necessity is the mother of Invention, Imagination is the power of Cinema. But there are many fellow movie-buffs who felt that Nolan had taken it too far under the cloak of imagination.When the question of whether all we see is possible arises, the answer comes from the McConaughey himself , ""It is not Possible, but it is necessary"". Now go back to the beginning of this para and read the quote (to understand the pun). I am from India, where we have our own flourishing movie industry and our moviegoers are second to one. In taste of good cinema we treat Hollywood as one of our one but it has been too long since I hear applause from the crowd once the credits started rolling. Now if it was FDFS, I wouldn't be surprised. But I watched it a good 3-4 days after its scheduled India release which tells us a lot about the way the common moviegoer perceived the movie. Applause may have stemmed from the Hope that was injected at the end or the brilliance of Nolan, I leave that your better judgement.My only grunt was that Einstein wasn't hear to see this venture. For it was he who wrote the ABCs on which the movie's foundation was laid.The character that impressed me the most, others may not feel the same way, was Dr.Mann. It wasn't Matt Damon's performance but the way it was penned that added grace and Drama to the story. It has proved that typical Human Survival instinct takes front seat no matter how far from earth we are. Before we start judging Dr.Mann (those who have watched the movie), we should ask ourselves the same question, ""Would I have done the same?""The cast has done its role, but let's be frank, they won't get Oscars for their performance. But they can settle down with a satisfying performance and for many in the crew, working with Nolan, is one off the bucket list.Interstellar: Stellar Indeed.",Interstellar

719,monsterhunt-94296,Stunning,9/10,8 July 2020,"Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, inspired by the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this movie for the first time a while ago, so not every detail is fresh in my mind, but it is very memorable and I have something to say. I think that everybody should watch Interstellar. It is one of those movies that everybody deserves to see in their lifetime. The premise of the movie is that Earth is dying, ""the Blight"" has basically destroyed almost all remaining food sources, with corn really being the last big plant. The movie focuses on Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, an ex-pilot for NASA who is now stuck farming (something he does not enjoy), and his relationship with his daughter Murph. The acting by everyone in this movie is phenomenal, and every relationship is painstakingly crafted. We get a good chunk of time on Earth to set up everything that will happen later in the movie. Eventually, we go into space, where we get some of the most realistic theoretical physics in any sci-fi movie. Everything in space looks amazing, actually the whole movie does. Christopher Nolan used no green screens when making this movie, and it shows, because all the sets are fantastic. The cinematography, tone, directing, and color palette are all perfect here. Everything about the look and feel of this movie is done perfectly. As for the story and screenplay, those are also done wonderfully. Even though this movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes long, it holds your attention for each and every second. You could allow yourself to get confused by all the physics trying to work it all out, but the emotional core of this movie within the story is captivating.That leads me into one of the biggest points about this move, the score. The score for Interstellar done by Hans Zimmer is my single favorite movie score of all time, with First Step basically being my favorite piece of music ever composed. The score fits the movie perfectly and adds so much emotional punch to an already emotional movie. There is one scene that is so emotional, and had me on the verge of tears the first time I saw it. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I don't want to spoil anything, so I apologize if I'm not going in depth, but I think everybody needs to watch it. Even if the big sci-fi physics aspect isn't your thing, it has such a strong emotional core. Some people aren't the biggest fan of the ending, but I had 0 problems with it. My only complaint is some of the characters aren't super developed, but that is such a minor flaw in comparison to how much I love this movie.Interstellar also has some things that could be interpreted about the death of film (like I said everything that could be done practically was done practically, and the movie was shot on celluloid film) and movies being plauged with digital and CGI. I think it's a really fascinating and important message that works well within the film.If you're thinking about watching Interstellar, go in with an open mind, as it actually seems to be pretty hit or miss for most people, but for me it was definitely a hit. Interstellar gets a 9.5 or 10/10, I'd need to rewatch it to decide which.",Interstellar

What if you could travel near the speed of light and take a trip, blah, blah, blah. You can't. They can't. Here's where the 8.8 rating comes from.

723,rrcharpe,Bad movie made worse by IMDb over-rating!,2/10,11 November 2014,"Unlike the majority of the viewers of this film commenting on IMDb I found it flat,unrealistic in the extreme and essentially another Hollywood dud. Many times the people who make these Sci-Fi films will literally flood the IMDb review section with positive reviews, causing the IMDb rating to go up and (they probably hope) causing more people to go see the movie. What disappointed me the most about this movie were the obvious scientific inaccuracies and distortions that made watching it more of a leap of faith rather than an exciting trip into mankind's future. As most people know (adults of course) is that there is no such thing as a ""stable"" wormhole. That premise was used ad infinitum by Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and just as lamely since there is ""no such thing"" as stability when discussing wormholes. Additionally, the ending made essentially no sense whatsoever. What else can I say except skip it unless you love gigantic bulging eyes crying all the time (Anne Hathaway) or checking out Matthew M's pecks. There was very little entertainment in the movie that's for sure. StocktonRob",Interstellar
724,Kop_Reaz,"""SCIENCE! BITCH!"" -Jesse, PInkman",8/10,22 January 2015,"That's my first reaction after watching Interstellar. The film itself is out of the world, both literally and metaphorically. It's an emotional voyage through space and time. Scientifically speaking, it's flawless. This is a true science fiction. They kept the stuffs we already know unchanged. And fictionalized the stuffs we yet to know. I don't understand people who don't understand physics going nuts over the science of Interstellar. *Nolan didn't show anything impossible*.The visuals is astronomically beautiful. And the musical score is even better. They kept me on the edge of my seat. I could feel every minutes of this film. Interstellar deserves this years Oscars in every visual and musical category. If Interstellar doesn't win all the five Oscars it has been nominated in, the Academy should get rid of these categories for good.Interstellar is a story of a love between a father and daughter, a promise and an inspirational journey to save the humanity. It is set in the future where survival is the ultimate goal. Which is why I felt the casts could not relate to their characters. Specially Mackenzie Foy. Her amateurish performance is the only downside of this film.Now excuse me I need to reevaluate my view on life, earth, humanity and God. (That's why I love the Nolans. They always reminds me how petty my life is right now and how much more I can do with it. There are limitless possibilities.)",Interstellar

731,SugarandIce,"Intelligent, beautiful, and uneven.",8/10,22 March 2015,"Nolan surprised me in that he's taken a special interest in adding emotion and heart to his latest film. This serves to humanize a very scientific plot. Unfortunately, the power of love does not mesh well with the concepts being presented here. Much of it is overdone. It also could have benefited from a trim down (especially on the Earth sections). This film overstayed its welcome, despite running out of time to tell its story. Let it be known, I have no problem with long films. I grew up watching Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings extended editions. Yet, the length was a bothersome factor here. I also lament that it didn't give us enough time to enjoy the beauty of the cosmos. We get glimpses, nothing more.That all being said, this is still a well-crafted, intelligent film. In beautiful simplicity it educates the audience of theory and consequences. There are also some genuinely heartwrenching scenes, some breathtaking sequences, and some heart-pounding moments. This film is one heck of a ride. The acting is a positive, as is Hans Zimmer's lovely score. Attributes and vices considered, Interstellar is a cinematic journey worth partaking in.

732,cmcastl,Appallingly badly written for a major serious sci-fi film,1/10,18 April 2015,"The various merits or demerits of Christopher Nolan's style of film-making is beside the point.This was the worst plotted and written major sci-fi film I have ever paid good money to see. Having seen it a few months ago now, that response firmly stays with me. To be sure, it had sumptuous production values and committed performances but this film cannot be considered serious sci-fi for how poorly it was plotted and written. I read that it had been written with serious scientific input from experts on black holes but that didn't show to me.Now I like space opera and I also like sci-fi films with ideas, the bigger the better. Black holes are incredibly complicated phenomena for the eggheads to understand, let alone the average or even the serious film-goer. Black holes also speculatively throw up all sorts of illogical ideas about their nature, which cause headaches for the scientists but which can be fun to work through on the silver screen. I wanted to like this film. I don't need my sci-fi to make perfect sense. I love Kubrick's 2001. I like the mystery and awe engendered by contemplating the cosmos, whether philosophically or dramatically. I just felt as I watched this film how my intelligence was being increasingly insulted by logical non-sequiturs of plot and character - even allowing for a scenario involving black holes where all kinds of paradoxes could and should be thrown at the characters and played around with - which were in my judgement the result of plain bad or lazy writing. This script had it not been written by the Nolans would never in my opinion have been passed in a film school project, let alone made into a big-budget film. I have ticked the box about the spoilers alert but I am not sure I have any spoilers to spill. It was a few months ago that I saw the film and I can now barely remember the plot because it made no sense to me on any level at the time. Even if a plot isn't easy to understand and appears illogical, and once again I re-iterate that with the inherent nature of the subject we are talking about metaphysical paradoxes here big-time, it ought to have an inner logic, make an inner sense. This was just a script-writing mess as far I could judge it. Incidentally, watching his Batman film I thought there was some very lazy plotting in that too, so this wasn't a one off. Does no one in Hollywood care anymore about good writing? Are major films now all about 'never mind the quality feel the width'?",Interstellar
733,ciobanualin-94020,Another great movie of Cristopher Nolan!,9/10,6 January 2021,"I've finished to watch ""Interstellar"" just today. For me it's not the best movie of Cristopher Nolan, but nevertheless, it's a great movie, which gives you a lot of emotions, an interesting storyline and a very good acting. Even if I didn't understand it how it's supposed to, the film is still great, because the storyline from Cristopher Nolan's movies is anytime complex.

734,agblum,Some Powerful Scenes - Does Make You Think,8/10,6 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan's latest film ""Interstellar"" plays off a number of themes and subjects. The movie is held in the near future. Earth is becoming environmentally unlivable, with Blight and Dust Storms scoring the land. Matthew McConaughey, plays ""Cooper"" a Widowed former NASA Pilot and Engineer, turned Farmer, who lives with his father-in law ""Donald"" (John Lithgow), Son Tom, and ten year-old daughter ""Murphy"", better know as ""Murph"", in what I feel is one of the best performances by a child actor in a movie I have seen, played by Mackenzie Foy, as she portrays deep emotion that is impressive for an actor of any age. Murph believes there is a ghost haunting her room, trying to communicate with her. Cooper discovers that the ""ghost"" is an unknown form of intelligence, sending them coded messages, by means of gravitational waves altering the dust on the floor, directing them to a secret NASA installation led by ""Professor Brand"", played by Michael Cane. Cooper is recruited by Brand for a Space Mission, believing that humanity's fight to survive is a losing battle and proposes that the solution is to colonize another galaxy. Cooper is joined by three astronauts, including Brand's Daughter ""Amelia"", played by Anne Hathaway. As mentioned, the movie plays off a number of themes and subjects. To Name Some - The Environment, Science, Space, Worm Holes, Other Dimensions, Passage of Time and Human Relationships – Parent to Child Love and Romantic Love.. The movie does have power moments, and is a visual treat at times, though there is one short visual sequence in the first 3rd of the movie that took part in Space, that didn't look that impressive to me. Caine, Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain, playing an older ""Murphy"" as the film progresses give very effective supporting performances. McConaughey, in his first major leading Film Role since his Oscar Winning Turn in ""Dallas Buyers Club"", performance gets more effective as the movie progresses. In the end, the Movie does make you think, and the powerful scenes are very emotionally moving. The science talk may go over one's head at times to a point. It is a film I will see again, and it may improve for me. For now, on first viewing, while not among my favorite Chirstopher Nolan Films, I give it 3 Stars out of 4 for it's emotionally moving scenes, played well by it's cast.",Interstellar

736,RocketeerFlyer,2001 remade & re-imagined for a New Generation,9/10,1 April 2015,"Do you like only Action Films? then this is probably not for you.Did you LOVE '2001'? then you'll probably LOVE this as it's very much a new re-imagined version for the 21st Century.It is a very emotional film (that I was not expecting) and a brilliantly made one, everything from the direction, acting, effects, score and story are spot on.Some may find the ending kinda hokey but I liked it and here's why...Think about this, if we humans do stick around long enough (we need to grow up a hell of a lot to do so...NO MORE KILLING EACH OTHER!!!) then who's to say what we might be capable of (just look how far we have come in such a short time!) in which case why couldn't we create such a wormhole? and a futuristic library? You may ask the question... Why would 'THEY' make it so damned difficult for us to get this information needed to help save our World? Why couldn't they have simply handed this to us if they were now THAT ADVANCED (it's a fair point) but then there would have been NO need to vist these worlds and have the encounter with the black hole on the other side of the wormhole putting them all in peril.Also, if our evolution advances us to the point where we humankind have progressed into this 4th dimension (a spiritual existence perhaps?) then maybe there was no way back into our current dimension in which case they needed to place this information within our reach and perhaps theirs too? with this futuristic human history library inside there (just a thought) Christopher Nolan is clearly a super film-maker and I for one hope he one day return to the science fiction genre.2001 still remains the better film but this has enough upgrades and differences to make it a very worthy and at times a real emotional roller-coaster of a film...making it a more HUMAN film than I thought.There may be faults with the Science (I just don't know! I don't think anyone really does? the stuff out there could be stranger than we can ever imagine) but it's a film you can watch, ponder and talk about with friends and family....Time itself maybe the strangest thing of all!So 'Birdman' won The BEST FILM 2015 Oscar!!! well sorry NO.What's worse is that 'Interstellar' was up for very few of those awards (shame on you) maybe the older members (and there are a lot) might have thought they had seen it before with 2001 and yes there are similarities but there's more of a human story here (I didn't think that would work but it did) and there are enough updated and modern differences to make it a very worthwhile film.ONE OF THE BETTER FILMS of the LAST DECADE",Interstellar
737,interestingfunstuff,"3 Of Us Fell Asleep, 6 Of Us - Out Of 7 - Hated It!",1/10,8 November 2014,"That's the score from a group of 7 friends who went to see Interstellar tonight. I've never been to a film in my entire life so full of DESPAIR. If I hadn't been with friends I would have walked out! I will avoid films by this director in the future like the plague.The only friend who liked it said she enjoys soap operas. That pretty much sums it up! IF YOU LIKE SOAP OPERAS YOU WILL LOVE INTERSTELLAR! There are so many plot holes several of us were cracking jokes by the end of the movie. So many parts of Interstellar are so ridiculous or makes no sense -whatsoever- it borders on camp. Sure the cinematography is magnificent. But in the end it's nothing but pretty wallpaper when the story is drawn out, tedious, annoying, maudlin, nonsensical, irrelevant, dopey and depressing. All I can say is when the only food humanity has left to eat is corn & corn products, then you are going to end up with a very corny movie!",Interstellar

739,tmf084,It's good but not great.,7/10,24 January 2015,"If you deconstruct the movie then most of its pieces are great in their own way (visuals, music score, casting, acting, story, etc), but the problem for me is that the pieces don't fit together and even overload the whole thing in a baroque-esque way. I like it simpler, but I can enjoy more elaborate movies, though, Nolan's MO is just so recognizable that you can't help to identify the issues while you are watching. His opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and Interstellar is no different. Still it also had a few things to it I liked, for instance, the story concept itself or omitting sound effects in space scenes (like it would be in a real vacuum) or touching on a few political topics with current relevance. So all in all, it's worth watching if you have 3 hours to spare.

740,pendenquejohn,Not my liking...,2/10,27 January 2015,"To be completely honest, this is easily the most boring movie I've probably ever watched. The first part of the movie is a complete utter bore. Things actually picked up a bit midway through when they reached to their destination but even so it then falls back as flat as it all started.Though the plot of the movie is quite an interesting one, it does take in my opinion a little bit too much time to get put into place which makes it really annoying at first. The lack of action of any sort, I mean even the most innocuous ones really brings the spectator to sleep all throughout.It's actually hard to keep focus during the whole thing without doing something on a side actually with the long sequences of boring dialog. These, between the different characters are rather toneless, emotionless and they all speak like as if they were in some sort of documentary. It's actually quite unfortunate because the story in itself is quite interesting but the way it is played is just completely boring.

743,Silfiriel,Don't watch it a third time,8/10,2 April 2020,"It's a great movie, but the third time I was watching it, everything seemed obnoxiously pretentious.
Especially the science dialogues, and an hour into the movie and everything sounds horrible, the acting as well, overacted.That's my advice, don't watch it a third time.When the movie came out it was celebrated for the scientific accuracy, now I feel like in about 50 years, when the science advances (hopefully) this movie will seem like that old short movie ""Journey to the Moon"" where the rocket lands in the moon's eye.Otherwise, the music is great, the story is beautiful, all nicely arranged.

744,Kimal9000,"Hollywood ""Blockbuster""; Star Wars meets E.T. - trying to be ""deep"" -flick",4/10,1 December 2016,"Not impressed. Mediocre acting, mainly from the three protagonists on the ship, and the tear jerking: ""love is a natural force pervading the universe""-crap, not to mention the wise-ass cowboy dialogue and the robot looking like a modern multi-function fridge and obviously meant to be a cross between C3PO and HAL9000, blew this movie for me.OK, trying to be serious; The story and idea IS a great one! Alas aimed at the masses, and thus poorly executed.The result is shallow, and it rushes things to the point of you feeling you must have slept through important plot scenes.I simply did not find the acting and dialogue believable. I mostly get the feeling that they are trying too hard! They REALLY want to make a great SciFi in the big league, but end up with an emo-version of 'Independence day'.Having seen, and been amazed by, masterpieces like '2001 A Space Oddysey', 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', I must honestly say that the score of over 8 by a million voters here is way to high! (Lots of youngsters there I think)This is simply an entertaining action movie with a ""message"". Not a GREAT science fiction movie that will stick with you like any of those mentioned above. I gave it a 4, although based on the action and effects alone, it could easily be a 6! But here, just as with 'Star Wars', there's to much childish crap going on that detracts.",Interstellar

746,temrok9,Glory!,9/10,11 November 2014,"With so many enthusiastic reviews, I thought I might not have to add one more, but I felt I owe it, in a way, to Nolan,as I have been very harsh with his movies up till now, considering Inception and Prestige almost silly and the Batman trilogy average but not great at all.Well, in Interstellar, which I went to see fearing the worst(clichés of sentimentalism and incoherent-in a bad way-plot), I was very pleasantly surprised.From the beginning, I found I was very fond of the way the film was shot, and in the long run I watched with undiminished attention, feeling that I was sorry the film was going to end at some point. I do not care if at some moments some scenes were not as convincing or as spectacular as they might have been, because I really was inside the movie all the time, a movie that gives back to science fiction cinema the glory it deserves.I even found some comments of critics-especially here in Greece-that were suggesting that the movie becomes melodramatic and weak as it unfolds, as untrue, although I would be the first to condemn such characteristics in a movie-and I was afraid Nolan would easily succumb to them.Instead, I felt deeply moved by the connection between the cosmic and the personal Nolan offers, in a screenplay that, at last, shines, not with cleverness, but with true wisdom, a perfect incorporation of astrophysics theory(that could again get easily ridiculous,if not properly handled) and even glimpses of humor.An epic that deserves its place in film history as an absolute winner!",Interstellar
747,avik-kumar-si,Nolan's stellar exploration of the outer space and matters of the heart,8/10,9 November 2014,"Interstellar is the latest offering from the modern master Christopher Nolan. After finishing with the Batman saga in his last offering, The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan now ventures beyond the terra firma. And in Interstellar, Nolan breaks new ground, both in terms of the vastness of outer space and the unknown territories of the human heart.Interstellar is essentially a story of man's travel across space in search of a new home. But it is also a drama spanning generations. Like The Godfather II, for a period of time, Interstellar too shuffles between two parallel tracks of two generations of a family battling their own battles - each in their own arena. Like in case of the two Corleone generations, the two battlefields here are also vastly different for the two generations. And the focus here too is on the lessons passed on from one generation to the next and the utility/ futility of those.If memory serves me right, this is Nolan's first film to feature one character lecturing another on love. This, along with more than one poignant father-daughter interactions, make Interstellar one of Nolan's closest brushes with human drama unadulterated by hints of suspense. I was looking forward to Nolan exploring this area of the filmmaking universe for some time now and hence these are my favourite bits from this sci-fi thriller-drama.Nolan has already proved himself capable of striking awe in terms of visual splendours and creating worlds different from our own humdrum ones. Hence, it is no surprise that he repeats that trick successfully once again in Interstellar. The visuals bear fleeting resemblance to the dream worlds in the Inception and the plot structure isn't entirely novel too, bearing some resemblance to one of Nolan's past cult works (hint: warp).But it is finally in Nolan's attempt at exploring the human sensitivities with more care than ever before which is the most promising aspect of Interstellar. Because it signals an expansion of Nolan's repertoire and holds out the promise that his best may be yet to come.Mathew McConaughey delivers a measured, restrained performance in the lead role and there are fine guest appearances from a number of others.In conclusion: while Interstellar may not yet bring Nolan his first Academy award, it will still be remembered as a stellar piece of work in its own right which marks a growth in not just the director's prowess but the vision of present-day cinema in general - to imagine far ahead on the platform of existing science.",Interstellar
748,baberchik,Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA,1/10,13 November 2014,"I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!",Interstellar

750,LeDentalPlaque,Stunning Visuals And Epic Sci-Fi That Lacks Scientific Authenticity in Some Areas,8/10,28 December 2014,"Being a scientist, I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Interstellar. Some of my colleagues have said it was a disgrace to the astrophysical society, while others have said that it was a sci-fi masterpiece. The only way I could see for myself was to go and watch this movie, so I went in with very high expectations. When I came out, I understood why I heard mixed reviews about Interstellar - because I have mixed feelings about it too and can't make up my mind about whether it's seriously awesome or just another sci-fi movie with some scientific authenticity.To start off, this movie contains a lot of science. You've got astrophysics, theoretical physics, geology, biology, ecology and more. It is literally a sci-fi jackpot. If we ignore all the scientific accuracy behind the movie and just focus on the plot, it's a strong and powerful one that definitely moves the audience. Just seeing the Earth's declining hospitality and trying to find an alternative planet to live on is a journey worth watching on the big screen. The graphics and CGI are absolutely amazing, and the new planets they explore are imaginative and in fact, quite realistic given the data presented about them. Even the black whole and its space-bending qualities are captured beautifully on screen.To be honest, I really enjoyed this movie even though it was a whopping three hours long. I believe it could have been cut a bit shorter to around 2.5 hours, but the pacing was decent and the plot moved along enough that the audience had time to ponder about the impending journey into the unknown. And this journey was written so well, interwoven with drama, emotion, romance, and a drive to save humanity.Apart from the movie itself, the score by Hans Zimmer fit in well with the events going on in the movie. It was certainly a bit repetitive and had hints of tones from his previous work (Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy), but it was done well enough to help elicit specific emotions from the audience during the astronauts' travels through space. Some pieces of music had you at the edge of your seat while others had a deeper tone that reflected humanity's last hope at finding salvation on a new planet.If you don't care about the authenticity of the science, then Interstellar is an amazing sci-fi moving that will go down into your list of modern classics. It's got a whole bunch of science, stunning visuals, and a great storyline. If you put all those together, you get a great movie.Now, I'll go into a little rant about the scientific authenticity behind Interstellar without giving away too many spoilers! There were some things that were explained nicely in the movie, such as relativity and the wormhole. But there were other key parts that did not make scientific sense. Let's start with the black hole. When an object approaches a black hole, it experiences what most scientists call ""spaghettification"", because the black hole's gravitational force is so strong that small distances within the object experience different amounts of ""pull"" from the black hole. As a result, if you were approaching a black hole feet first, your feet would be pulled into the black hole before your knees, elongating your feet, then calves, etc. until your entire body was a strand of spaghetti. You definitely would not survive, but it would certainly be a cool way to go out. However, the fact that the spaceship and astronaut came out unscathed from the black hole encounter...that's very far off from known astrophysical and mathematically-defined theories about the black hole's gravitational pull.The next part is Mann's planet, which is completely composed of ice and ice clouds. Scientifically speaking, the density of ice would not be able to sustain such movements and structures seen on that planet. This is a minor detail though, and not as significant to complain about.Another issue was the amount of fuel the shuttle had to hop from planet to planet. Even though they tackled the question of fuel capacity in the movie, there would certainly not be enough fuel from today's knowledge to be able to travel so much back and forth between the planet and the station. Finally, what I didn't like about the movie, in terms of its scientific relevance, was the method of study for science itself. In the opening scenes, they mentioned gathering data, providing evidence, then making statements...this is true. However, a key part they are missing here is sharing data. All scientists communicate with each other in order to advance science and propel scientific breakthroughs. The lead professor in this case was withholding information from the entire human race, and another was willing to commit multiple counts of murder to steal the spaceship for himself when he was rescued by the crew. Those were some iffy parts to the story that I think were illogical and unnecessary.As a result, because of the portrayal of scientists and some contradictions between the movie and the scientific background, I give this an 8/10. In all honesty though, it's one of the best realistic space movies in the past few years and much more purposeful and powerful than Gravity. Whether or not you care about the science, I think everyone should watch this film if they can withstand the 3 hours.",Interstellar
751,diogomanuel,What a journey!,10/10,11 October 2017,"The most beautiful space age movie I have ever seen, and one of the best ever made. You passionately understand and sympathize with the story from the very beginning! Matthew McConaughey brilliant performance makes sure that we as an audience follow his heart and mind, sometimes he doesn't even has to say anything and we know what he wants and where he is going. Brilliantly written as it makes us eager to know what happens next and it ends with a proper ending without needing a sequel! However, if they decide to make one even better, I will certainly watch it!This is what Hollywood should do more often!A must-see 10 out of 10 movie!

753,fustbariclation,"Truly, one of the worst, most racist and badly acted films I have ever watched.",1/10,18 March 2015,"I could not have believed quite how bad Interstellar is. It is truly dreadful. After six months travelling, with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole, the token Blackman speaks to the hero (who has his suntan intact): Massa, Massa, what is going on? The hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor, ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole. If he didn't know this, WTF was he doing on the trip? Their understanding of relativity is at the level I'd expect from my goldfish. They give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from Earth - for some reason in B&W. The hero goes through, as Dorothy Parker said, all the emotions from A to B. They claim it is a post colonial world, but the space suits all have the US flag on them. The spaceship controls are circia 1960. Poor Michael Cain, is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? To be fair, it is, unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless. Avoid this film if you possibly can.",Interstellar
754,hgieselmann,Why Mr. should release a shorter Directors cut,8/10,2 April 2015,"So I just watched Interstellar now for the second time on blu-ray, and I think I have an idea, why there is a big hole in the movie and how it could be avoided. On the extras of the bluray they don't stop pointing out how scientifically accurate interstellar is, but at one point they throw all logic over board, and I don't mean the trip in the black hole. Its just after they leave the worm hole and consider which planet they should visit first. They go for the one thats closest to the black hole and were time runs 60.000 times as slow as on earth. thats one hour in seven years. But if this is known to the crew, wouldn't everyone go for the other planets first, even if it would take months to get there? secondly if the time on the planet runs so slow, wouldn't the gravity be several magnitudes higher, so that nobody could walk around there? and would time go as nearly as slow in the capsule in the orbit as on the planets surface so the left behind crew couldn't grow old so quickly? My solution for this problem is, just cut out 15 minutes where they visit the water planet, re-film a short sequence in the capsule where they decide to go to the ice planet first and everyone is fine. The could explain that murph got old just by explaining that time slowed down for them when they passed the worm hole. By cutting out the water planet, Intestellar would lose its largest logic hole, would get a bit more focused pace and make it to the end credits in 150 minutes. another thing is the use of the imax camera. it produces magnificent pictures and the mobile version was even small enough to film inside cars. but why didn't they use it for the whole film? now we have the annoying switching from letterbox to imax and back. next time i would like to see a complete scifi flick in imax.",Interstellar
755,ikizdevran-882-254684,The end of Earth will not be the end of us.,9/10,1 July 2018,"The world is coming to an end. NASA is working on finding an alternative planet for human existence. To execute this mission, three astronauts led by ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) are travelling to the other side of the galaxy to examine possible planets suitable for establishing a human colony. As story suggests, ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi film along with adventure and drama. Christopher Nolan wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, produced it with his wife Emma Thomas and directed it himself. It has a runtime of 169 minutes and premiered on October 26, 2014.""Interstellar"" focuses more on human feelings and emotions than the logical part of space travel. Since the very beginning of the film, we see a special bond between a father and a daughter. This special bond will save the humanity. All the other elements, all the logic behind the space travel, black holes, gravity, relativity, time and dimensions are to create a good background story for humanity in pursue of a new home and new hopes. In my opinion this is the main idea of ""Interstellar."" Of course, in a good film you expect each element to be perfect and detailed. Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne is both scientific consultant and executive producer and thanks to his contributions to the production, physics and essentials of space travel are explained to the audience in the simplest way possible through the passionate conversations during the whole film. To understand ""Interstellar,"" you need to have a general idea about physics. Things you learn in the film about space and physics are just fascinating. All this scientific and logical explanations about our earth and space travel that are combined with human emotions and feelings make ""Interstellar"" a very interesting film. There is a perfect balance of logic and feelings in the film just like the perfect balance in our galaxy.Giving up on their lives, families, friends and comfort zones, those four astronauts are devoting themselves fully to human race and their salvation. No physical rule in the world can explain the enormity of this sacrifice. Therefore, ""Interstellar"" is a story based on human emotions. The great balance between emotions and logic is the strongest point of the film. This idea is supported by passionate conversations, gestures and mimics and scientific displays.While watching ""Interstellar,"" I got deep into thoughts about our existence and the earth we are living in. How the perfect balance of physics makes life a possibility. How gravity and relativity work and how they are related to us. Thinking about possible life forms on other planets. All those thoughts together with the story gave me chills almost the whole time. Of course, visual and sound effects have a lot to do with the transmission of those thoughts. Visual effects in the black hole and throughout the film were amazing and the film won the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. The sound and the music are also powerful. Using music and sounds in the right moments have a manipulative effect in the film. For example, you get excited in the scenes that are not exciting because of the usage of right sounds. Take off scene is just one of them. This combination of visual effects with right sounds earned the film Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing. ""Interstellar"" has one additional nomination for best product design.I liked all the main characters from Anne Hathaway to Michael Caine, from Jessica Castain to Matt Damon but I need to open a special parenthesis to Matthew McConaughey. His character Cooper is a hero, all the humanity is depending on him that's why his mental strength must be felt by the audience to believe in him. With his Texas accent and physical features McConaughey shows an outstanding performance in the film. In every scene you see his passion and not mentioning several close-up weeping scenes. With the camera shots (33mm in anamorphic format) Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema fits well in the brilliant picture of the film. In some parts camera itself is telling the story even though this is something you don't get to see a lot in Nolan films. He mostly uses the camera to illustrate the story. Soundtracks are made by my personal favorite composer Hans Zimmer. When the sounds are not used, you get to enjoy beautiful soundtracks.Each component of ""Interstellar"" is detailed and beautiful, aiming to give audience something. From all the points of view, ""Interstellar"" deserves all the credits to qualify as a masterpiece. It is one of the best example of epic sci-fi genre as well. Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",Interstellar
756,percyporcelain,Turgid concatenation of sci-fi clichés,2/10,10 April 2015,"Christopher Nolan does sci-fi... to which I feel like saying to this hitherto great director, don't bother! The cinematography is great but that's about it, otherwise it's like 2001, Blade Runner and Star Trek all thrown into a blender with a shot of gratuitous emotional hysteria carved out of a soap opera sub-plot, or perhaps left over from Ann Hathaway's Les Mis histrionics. Meanwhile Matthew McConaughey croaks away like some Field-of-Dreamsesque sharecropper catapulted into space for no obvious reason like it's a case of mistaken identity or something. Way too long and all but the most hardened space cadets will bale out before re-entry.

757,parrot007,Christopher Nolan is a creative genius and a master of his craft.,9/10,3 March 2020,"I absolutely love seeing Nolan's imagination come alive on screen. While this movie does require a strong suspension of disbelief, once you get past that it really makes you think about some profound ideas, as well as telling more than one compelling personal stories that blend well with these themes.Interstellar starts a bit slow, but the payoff for the things it sets up is totally worth it and ties it together really nicely. There are a couple of scenes in this fairly long movie that don't quite hit the way I wanted, but it didn't take away from the overall feel of this deliberately slow paced film.Christopher Nolan is seldom trying to present a direct message to viewers, and by no means is that a bad thing. Just like Inception, its meant to plant imaginative seeds in our minds and make people think bigger about what our reality is, and what more it can be beyond what we can percive. He even brilliantly brings abstract concepts to life in a certain scene in this move I refuse to spoil.I hate seeing people who say these two movies ""don't make any sense"" or ""have too many plotholes"". You need to open your mind and realize the reason Inception and Interstellar are great is because of their ideas, not because they're perfectly grounded in reality. I get that Nolan might try to explain these ideas a little too much sometimes, but you have to establish some ground rules for such grand ideas.Stop saying ""this doesn't make sense"" They're Science Fiction movies!! Failing to recognize that is YOUR problem, not the movie's.",Interstellar

760,xanderlm,Very well-written film!!!!!,10/10,16 October 2021,"This is likely one of my top 5 favourite movies of all time. The story was very well-written and is realistic without sacrificing the evocative and awe-inspiring nature of the best space/time-travel movies...just an overall transcendent experience. You have to pay attention to every little thing that happens in this film to really understand the plot, straight from the get-go, but its so worth it when realizations are made at the climax. The acting is phenomenal, but that's to be expected when you pair up Jessica Chastain and Matthew McConaughey- their father/daughter bond is the heart and soul of this movie. Even as it ends on a hopeful note, there is an underlying sadness throughout the movie (which Hans Zimmer's score brings out beautifully) that really adds to its weighty and monumental feel and keeps you rooting for the main characters. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. I highly, highly recommend.

761,Critomaton,"Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still pretty epic and powerful",8/10,15 November 2014,"Alternate title: What?!? Sorry I can't hear what you said over the sound of Hans Zimmer's organ.An interesting movie-going experience, this was. I say, go see it in IMAX (if you feel like coughing up the extra $9-10 per ticket). There will be several points during the film where you won't be able to understand a word of the dialog being spoken due to the blaring soundtrack. In some cases, whatever happened during that scene will be explained later, in others not. But the visual impact of many of the scenes is so powerful that I'm glad I experienced them in the largest format available.You gotta give Christopher Nolan credit. The guy ""goes big or goes home"" - and he doesn't often go home, certainly not this time. I was moved to tears a few times during this movie, laughed several times, was awed a lot, and thought a lot.I went into the movie having read many of the reviews on IMDb - mostly negative ones - and I actually enjoyed the movie more having had it ""spoiled"". This way I already knew I wouldn't be able to hear some of the dialog, and I was prepared for some of the sappier plot twists. It helped me appreciate the movie more because almost everything the nay-sayers didn't complain about was highly enjoyable (and some of the things they complained about didn't bother me at all).For one thing, the boxy robots definitely stole the show. Calling them boxy isn't quite fair - they get quite a lot of traction -literally - from being composed of articulated rectangular slabs. And when their dialog wasn't being drowned out it was very, very clever.Oh, and actually it wasn't really the robots that stole the show. It was McConaughey. Lincoln clearly took their cue from Reese's Pieces and E.T. (not M&M's), because having Matthew M. start hawking their luxo-boats shortly before the release of this movie was a brilliant marketing strategy. Matthew's folksy every-man is exactly what was needed in this role (Interstellar I mean, but I guess it goes for luxury SUV salesman as well), and he played it perfectly. It especially helps that he can express a range of emotion with his face since we can't hear him a lot of the time. Same with Anne Hathaway. And I always thought Michael Caine was way too famous and distinguished a face to be believable as a mere butler, but he did fine as an ethically conflicted astrophysicist.The supporting cast - Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and the actors who played Coop's children, played their roles well also.Like Titanic, this was a very fast (almost) 3 hours and that's a sign of an entertaining movie. It's weird, because there weren't even really that many big action scenes or plot transitions. I guess they were all just nicely padded with explanatory scenes that didn't feel like filler to me.Yes, there was no real ""M. Night Shyamalan twist"" here because the surprise ending was blatantly telegraphed from the beginning. And yes there is lots of science and pseudo-science and head-scratching stuff that doesn't seem plausible (and probably isn't) but somehow it all just works.And yes there were things I didn't like about Interstellar, in addition to the earsplittingly ham-handed sound editing. For example, I wish they'd have tried harder to convince us that Earth was in peril (yeah, I know, who are ""they?""). The alternations between ""Dust Bowl, Kansas"" and ""Field of Dreams, Iowa"", both with well maintained and fully fueled pickup trucks (and no civil strife) rang kind of hollow. But then again, maybe that strange duality is not so far from the truth as the world exists today, and lots of people would love a Plan B right here, right now.The comparisons with 2001: A Space Odyssey are inevitable, and I think Interstellar holds up quite favorably in that match-up (so favorably it wins by TKO). Interstellar has every element of 2001 - the realistic space scenes, the psychedelic space scenes, the epic majestic score (it's no Also Sprach Zarathustra but not much is), artificial intelligence as a main character, and the intriguing, highly speculative commentary on the evolution of the human race. But Interstellar's ""wow factor"" to ""snooze factor"" ratio is much better than 2001's, and its emotional factor (on a scale of 1 to 10) is around 11 (I think only Saving Private Ryan has moved me more), whereas 2001's emotional factor is about -5.In summary, Interstellar is entertaining enough that regardless of whether you end up thinking it's been over-hyped, it's probably still worth a look-see on the big screen.",Interstellar

763,Incendid,Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey.,7/10,5 December 2014,"2001: A Space Odyssey revolutionised the way sci-fi films are made and the way audiences view them. So naturally over the last 46 years, many film makers have tried to recreate the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, however in my opinion I do not believe any film maker has achieved the magic that Kubrick created back in 1968. However when I heard that Christopher Nolan would be creating Interstellar, a new and original film about space and humanity, it became clear that Interstellar would be paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey throughout the whole film. However i am not saying that Interstellar is just a direct homage, it is in it's own, an original film that shows themes that 2001: A Space Odyssey did not. The theme of love is a key element in the story, the theme of survival is also a key element in the story, both these themes distinguish Interstellar from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Interstellar is a great film about humanity, survival, love, exploring the unknown and the human experience, all these themes are given the respect they deserve and provide the audience with a clever and complex plot that provides for great cinema. Unfortunately, some of the magic of the film is lost through Nolan's exposition where he spoon-feeds the audience everything they need to know and more. This defeats the mystery and edge the film should have, instead we are given so much information that the story actually begins to drag.On the other hand, Interstellar makes up for this by providing the audience with a visual experience worth watching on the big screen in its highest quality. The blend of visual and practical effects provides the audience with a space that looks believable and awe- inspiring. Nolan presents his visual masterpiece in such a professional and interesting way that the audience is kept entertained with the visuals even if the story begins to drag.The acting in Interstellar was great. Anne Hathaway provided a great performance along with Michael Caine, Matt Damon and John Lithgow, but the real magic of the film came from the father-daughter relationship between Matthew McConaughey's character Cooper and Mackenzie Foy's character Murph, their relationship was what kept me and invested in the film, i wanted to see if they would ever see each other ever again, i wanted the two to come back together. Their relationship is what drove the movie and allowed the audience to connect to the characters in Interstellar's complex plot.To sum up, Interstellar is a good film that could have been great with a little bit of tweaking, not Nolan's greatest film but without a doubt one of his greatest visual achievements that everyone should definitely go and watch on the big screen to enjoy the cinematic experience that is Interstellar. Therefore Interstellar is receiving a 7/10.",Interstellar

When Cooper accepts the offer of Professor Brand to join the explorers for the world, his ten year old daughter Murph doesn't want him to go. But Cooper decides to go and it becomes a battle against time and the search for a new world.To start with the script; Jonathan and Christopher Nolan both did an fantastic job writing this story on screen. There are, included, really strong dialogues between the characters and they really develop throughout the story. There are so many different story lines in this film but everything single thing happens for a reason- and for everything is an explanation at the end. The story is really complicated but very well developed. The film is really long as most Christopher Nolan film but this one was not so long that you might lose your interest in the film. He plot is interesting and keeps you into the story.Looking at the casting everybody did an acceptable job. I was not very convinced about how Matthew McConaughey filled in his role but MacKenzie Foy, and Michael Caine were brilliant! They really convinced me.In a Sci/Fi movie special effects are , especially, really important and Interstellar made us of it brilliantly. When they get in space and when action is taking place it just looks like you're watching documentary it just looks so real, like your really there. That was a wonderful cinematic experience which I haven't seen any more since Gravity.

765,victordelavieter,Couldn't make heads or tails of it,5/10,22 December 2016,"In European eyes this movie starts out as a too American-çliché story. Coop is an Elvis lookalike farmer with a conspicuous drawl, a Nastasia Kinski lookalike daughter and a rusty father (John Lithgow. They live - surprise, surprise - in a cabin-style farmhouse on the prairie. The first 30 minutes have such a strong John Wayne feel to them, one almost expects Coop to ride into the sunset on a horse instead of a truck towards a secret Nasa base. A hard-to-believe Hollywood-style coincidences lead to McConaughey heading a critical mission to faraway planets save the earth. Coop is guided to a secret NASA base via gravity waves in his daughter's room, then gets asked to lead a mission to save mankind the next moment and whoosh... we find ourselves on a foreign planet. If this movie wasn't taking itself so serious, it's almost a parody. A real crisis then happens when the explorers get hit by a Tsunami. Yes, a Tsunami. Somebody in the scenario writing department has been watching too much CNN news at that time. Because of a time speed difference, 25 of earth years pass. An emotional scene happens when Coop views the accumulated messages from earth. A next planet has to be chosen. Dr Brand has fallen in love with the astronaut that was sent to one of the planets, and proposes to go there. The astronaut on that planet goes insane, exit love interest. The planet was uninhabitable anyway, as he duped them in believing it was a paradise. As this exploring seems to be sort of a family business, meanwhile on earth, the scientist who started all this, who is also her father dies. A similar father-daughter thin happens when Coop reaches his daughter, who also has become a space scientist, at a young a age via the fifth dimension. He then tells her the clues to time travel via black holes via morse code on an analogue watch which she finds in her old room 30 years later. They find a greener planet. Mankind is saved. Why Coop is able to travel though time, pushing books from shelves on earth while in another galaxy but unable send through a piece of data? I have no clue. Questions, questions. Not unusual for an unintelligent space movie rated 5,4 with too much focus on cheap emotion and too little on a credible story. But I got interested because of the 8,5 rating. Strange. This is on move I couldn't make heads or tails of.",Interstellar
766,the_horned_owl,"Magnificent, Breathtaking, Heart Wrenching and Thought Provoking",10/10,11 November 2014,"When I heard that Chris Nolan was going to make a sci-fi about space, I wasn't impressed as I have already seen Gravity and It wasn't so great. I mean its good but 97% on RT doesn't make any sense. Anyways I watched the movie yesterday and was blown away. Its a visual masterpiece from Nolan, who has given us movies like Memento, Inception, The Dark Knight and The Prestige. Its a great movie no doubt. I don't really understand why people are saying bad things about its scientific accuracy. it is sci-fi. every sci-fi movie has mistakes. Nolan worked so hard on this movie and made it one of the best sci-fi movies. It is Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey. common we can give some credit to the man for his hard work.Now I would like to clear some doubts:THE BIG WAVE :: Scientist Neil DeGrasee Tyson has confirmed that the waves that we see in miller's planet will be a reality because it is under the influence of gravitational pull of a black hole.WHAT IS MICHAEL CAINE TRYING TO FIND :: Well, he wants to take people from earth to a planet where life is possible. Practically you cant make a spaceship which can carry such large number of people. So he is trying to solve an equation which can make it happen. if he is able to solve the equation we can control gravity and make space stations which do not get affected by gravity so we can carry large amount of people away from earth without the need of rockets. He needs the data from inside a black hole as black holes have infinite gravity which we call singularity. You have to find how gravity works and for that you need the data from singularity as gravity can travel across galaxies. so the five dimensions are 3D, time and gravity.WHERE ARE THEY LIVING IN THE END :: Murph solved the equation so they were able to make such space stations which can leave earth without the need of rockets. SO they are living on space stations. There are many. They have made five dimensions a reality.WHAT ABOUT THAT LOVE THING: Harry Potter didn't die, you know why ?? Hope you got your answer. Movies are made to give you some life lessons.So Nolan tried to do his best and I appreciate it ( I mean tell me the name of any other director who worked with a scientist to make a movie as accurate as possible. Nolan worked with Astrophysicist Kip Thorne and it led to a scientific discovery). I really enjoyed the movie, I cried as it is so emotional and I am still thinking about the movie. Go and watch it instead of finding small mistakes because in the end it is a science FICTION.",Interstellar
767,yeah-99985,"A bold, emotional and intellectual sci-fi epic",9/10,12 November 2017,"Good:Amazing direction, cinematography, acting and soundtrack. Well written original story filled with emotionally relatable characters and scientific accuracies. Grand, incredible visuals and imagery of space that evoke the senses and emotions of viewers. Bad:A few draggy expositions in the first half of the movie.

768,DonB-5,Best space movie since 2001,10/10,8 November 2014,"Over the last 40+ years we movie viewers have been entertained by fun but pretty inane space movies for the most part. Star Wars and Star Trek and all that. Decent entertainment but not much depth. And as for the science - left a lot to be desired.Reading some of the reviews and some of the Q&A on the message board its clear to me that some viewers are going to get lost in the science. And make no mistake - this movie is chock full of scientific concepts and possibilities. We can thank the consulting by Kip Thorne and others for that.The first time we are shown space travel, in the vacuum of space, with no sounds from the rockets or anything else - I knew this would be a special movie. I can't recall another movie other than 2001 thats been this daring (and I bet some viewers wondered where the rocket noise was!) and actually got something this basic right.The thrill ride evolves from this simple start. An absolute masterpiece and a must see for any true sci-fi fan.",Interstellar

770,ebm123,It was interesting,7/10,12 February 2021,"I recommend it if you like sci-fi.It was interesting because I could not predict the next line in the plot.
It has really good music and poetry.
It has great photography, especially the giant wave scene or Matt's docking.What I did not like is the cast.
Jessica Chastain is not pleasant, Anne Hataway is not for sci-fi (she is good is comedies). But Matthew was good in this role and he saved the movie.

771,emailmadhurimasen,Unpopular opinion: not that great a film,7/10,8 September 2020,"I had heard a LOT about this film, and how people had to watch it several times to fully grasp its complexity. I came to the film with tons of expectations but it was kind of a letdown.
Half baked characters, especially the women. I am not qualified to question the science, so not getting into that at all. What I can say is that the motivations of characters are extremely sketchy. Emotions are not Nolan's forte. The scenes in which characters wax poetic about love are just bad.

772,jacoblawrence-19058,Another Strong Nolan Film,7/10,19 July 2021,"Nolan continues his hot streak as he plays with the fabric of time once again. You feel like you're on an adventure for the last 2 hours of the movie and the editing, camerawork, and effects create a fully immersive experience. It is worth noting that for such a long movie, the initial stage was set rather abruptly though with particular emphasis on the time between when Cooper discovers NASA to when he's blasting off into space.McConaughey delivers another strong performance for his resume while Hathaway is slightly less convincing than usual. Overall though, an (inter)stellar cast brings life to the screen while Nolan breathes new life into the sci-fi drama genre.Additionally, the premise is actually quite interesting and I would have liked to have seen more depth on that subject matter early on to create a stronger sense of urgency for the mission. The idea of humans trying to escape earth rather than save it felt new and I would have appreciated more scenes of the ""dying earth"" early on in the film. Nevertheless, Interstellar takes us on a Grade A adventure with everything to lose and it just about delivers.",Interstellar
773,jameswilliams784,Good Movie,7/10,11 April 2015,"Interstellar is a good movie and a must see for Sci-Fi fans. Although others might disagree, I would call this a combo of 2001 and Gravity. The plot of the movie is that life on Earth is coming to an end from a global grain blight and another Dust Bowl. Unless a new place for the Human Race is found, Human life will not live on. A leading Scientist, Michael Cain, discovers a stable worm hole giving the possibility of a new beginning for the Human race - if a planet is found that can support Human life. So a crew is assembled to go through the worm hole to try to find a new home for the Human race. The Crew is lead by Mathew McConaughy and Ann Hathaway. The team has to deal with leaving loved ones behind as they search for a new home. McConaughy gives a great performance and so does Hathaway, although I would have liked to have seen more of her in this movie. Overall this movie has great special effects, a decent story, good suspense, and is very enjoyable. The only downside of this movie is its too long. So this one is an enjoyable movie experience.

774,Chillihead1,Wow,10/10,17 July 2015,"I have never left a review before - I had to review this film. From the strong and intriguing opening montage I got the feeling that this would be an interesting albeit long film. The beginning is a master class in character development and sets the scene for every moment yet to enjoy. Despite being over 2 1/2 hours long, the viewing time felt short. This is a film to watch. From start to finish there are none of the usual attention grabbers, just mellow relaxing music and acting of the highest degree, every character is believable, deep and multi faceted. Matthew McConaughey is spectacular, what an amazing actor (I will now watch his other films). A brief and limited review, please watch this believable and gripping film, it has to be the most enjoyable 2:49 I have spent for many years. I watch few films more than twice, I am on my second viewing right now.

775,sunshinebeachcinema,Some films are stellar. This film was Interstellar.,10/10,2 September 2015,"Interstellar came at the end of 2014 to give us a Christmas blockbuster worthy of leaving our warm hearths for. I saw it late after a stretch abroad, but I'm glad I caught it on the big screen, even if it was the 'Bijou' screen of my local cinema. Some films excel at spectacle, and this really deserved to be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible, so count yourself lucky if you managed it.The film is a science fiction epic, but it's not an outlandish fantasy. Forget Avatar. Has anyone watched Avatar recently? Interstellar feels grounded in possibility with ideas full of personal conflict and universal philosophy. The story begins some fifty odd years in the future on an Earth devastated by crop blights. The world is becoming a barren dustbowl as humanity struggles to feed itself.Our hero is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a widowed former pilot turned farmer who ekes out a living with his father-in-law and two children Tom and Murphy. The film does well to establish this world; a parent-teacher meeting where children are denied a college application so they can become farmers and an early action sequence where Cooper salvages a downed Indian drone for parts hint at the environmental, technological and geopolitical situation of this future world.The main narrative starts when a mysterious signal leads the ever inquisitive Cooper to the remnant of NASA, helmed by Cooper's old professor Dr. Brand (frequent Nolan-collaborator Michael Caine) who offers him the chance to join a secret mission to find a new homeworld for humanity. A wormhole has been discovered near Saturn which leads to a system of potentially habitable planets orbiting a supermassive black hole.Here begins the struggle and the decisions Cooper and his family must make. Should humanity continue to fight the losing battle on Earth, or abandon it? Should a man leave his family for the future of humanity, or live out what life he can with them, as best he can on a dying world?At the heart is Cooper's relationship with the daughter he leaves behind (Jessica Chastain) and her struggle to forgive him as she grows up to become a scientist herself. The relationship is paralleled with Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who joins the mission to look for something else among the stars.Christopher Nolan is a twenty-first century auteur and his films are always ambitious, complex and engaging. Even if that ambition is sometimes stretched, he never shrinks from a bold idea. But it's not just a philosophical narrative. While emotional through and through, the film also explores its conflict through gripping action and spectacular visuals, and its pioneering attitudes through the inclusion of cutting edge scientific thought.Okay, so you don't have to understand every part of the physics; some artistic licence has undoubtedly been taken for the sake of story or spectacle, and there are 'Star Trek' times when characters with a scientific background explain their complicated plans to each other with a simple analogy (a technique immortalised by Fry in Futurama), but we're here to watch a movie, not a lecture in theoretical astrophysics.The result is that the characters not only explore foreboding new worlds of ice and oceans but deal with the vaguely realistic implications of exploring wormholes and black holes, such as time dilation and intense space-time-warping gravity. This is used to great emotional effect; imagine communicating with your family at home when hours of your time is years of theirs and your messages can 'only' travel at the speed of light.It's enough that theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was present as a consultant to know we're in safe hands. Thorne collaborated with Carl Sagan on the latter's novel Contact, which became a film in 1997 and dealt with the communication between a father and daughter across the void of space and also happened to feature Matthew McConaughey in a supporting role.Interstellar seems like a spiritual successor but stands on the shoulders of another giant, that unforgettable epic journey to the edges of the solar system and beyond: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968); although that film's astronaut Dave had no family keeping him on Earth. It's worth mentioning here that the cubic robots that assist on the mission are markedly less homicidal. The robots have been brilliantly realised with inventive simplicity as real puppets played by actors and not CGI.The effects as a whole are a cinematic experience; the spaceship blasts through the void to ludicrous organ overlays and emerges overlooking the black hole, a magnificently realised singularity of ultimate light and darkness simulated using Thorne's mathematics. Then a moment of peace, all the more accentuated after the volume, allowing us to ponder the 'gravity' of the situation in more ways than one.I read an article explaining that the pipe organ was for a long time the world's most complex man-made device, this scientific significance a possible reason behind its inclusion, aside from the obvious spiritual associations. Organ pipes also have a visual similarity to spaceship engines, reminding me of Boston Third Stage album cover where the band's signature organ is presented as just that.My only word on the film's ending is that it comes very close to undercutting Cooper's sacrifices by letting him have his cake and eat it, but after the mind-bending finale, we're on board enough just to go along with the ride. So I'll leave it there.The word 'stellar' is sometimes used to describe something of an extremely high standard, but it's hard to say now without sounding like you're quoting Stanley Kowalski. I think it's time for a change, so this film gets full marks because it was Interstellar.",Interstellar
776,artdonovandesign,An Absolute Masterpiece of Cinematic Art,10/10,26 December 2018,"The other reviewers have said it far more eloquently than I.I've viewed it perhaps over three dozen times. The complexity is astounding! Every aspect of the film, from the story line, script, acting, music and editing is a Magnum Opus for the Nolan brothers.IMHO Interstellar equals and perhaps surpasses 2001 as one of the finest, most mature and most important science fiction films to date.

777,dpg-87522,One of the best Nolan´s movies,7/10,5 October 2019,"Christopher Nolan is one of those directors who do not see each day, is known and respected for the trilogy of the knight of the night and for telling his stories in different chronological order. Interstellar was a film acclaimed both by critics and by the audience, it could be said that these were the main reasons why I wanted to see it, apart from Matthew McConaughey being the protagonist. The movie has a good start, because you understand who is who and what you need to know about the main characters. The performances are as always in the excellent Nolan movies, the comrade movements seemed good to me, the environment I loved because it is not fictional, you think that what you are seeing is real. The script is great in the sense that you can understand that Nolan made him want since he even bothered to ask a professional in Astronomy to help write the script. The plot may sound something simple but it is really very complex, it would be that the characters have to find a habitable approach to save humanity from extinction, if that sounds very simple, but it is not because there is more like that mission itself was a farce and the human relationships of the characters. The relationships of the characters feel real, the movie made me feel how the characters felt, it is very emotional to see how Cooper takes his time to decide whether to go to the mission to save humanity or stay with his children in the earth, for example when Cooper is taking the mission and his daughter tries to reach him desperately, you manage to feel the sadness that the characters feel at that moment, and that is something that not many films achieve, if their realization with Murph is quite complex, you could say that the main theme of the film is love, everything is done for love, in fact you could say that love is what saves humanity, the connection between Murph and Cooper is so strong that it helps Murph to save the humanity from extinction. But no matter how emotional it is, Nolan did not make a perfect movie, since in itself, it makes no sense that a secret government organization hires a subject who has not seen in years for such an important mission, and when the characters go to the water planet and one of the characters stays on the ship, I understand that the hours spent there were 20 years on earth and on the ship, therefore I have to ask myself questions like: How the hell did that guy survive 20 years on the ship alone without losing his sanity, entertaining himself and not resorting to suicide? Did they have provisions for 20 years? Wow, that guy really deserves all my respect, for surviving that, and the truth is that something that surprised me about Nolan was that, it was very obvious those who were going to die and those who were going to live, I say they surprised me because Nolan He is a respected director for not making mediocre mistakes, if he may make mistakes in his movies, but not as mediocre and repetitive as that. In conclusion Interstellar is a film that I personally liked very much, with good performances, an interesting environment, a good direction, characters with personality, but with things that have weight for plot, which are the opposite of reality, this movie It deserves a 7/10 but I will make an exception, for the good attitudes, for the complexity of the protagonists, because Nolan took the trouble to ask for help from a professional for the script and because I am very entertained, it is because that this movie for me is an 8/10.",Interstellar
778,palashdebrayd,Ahead of time!,9/10,23 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan made a breathtaking masterpiece which talks about the future, where hope and love help to the survival of human species. But, somehow it's an over ambitious one, a bit further from imagination.And may be it's the beauty of intellectual provision.

781,ilawadehla,"In my mind, science fiction is the first.",8/10,7 April 2020,"The core of this film is a family drama, a story about love and commitment between father and daughter.The film allows the most real and warm feelings and waiting of human beings to naturally infiltrate into the grand and solemn human epic of space immigrants.Nolan is good at wrapping sincere emotions in a grand narrative, and his manipulation and expression are undoubtedly superb.
This story deduces a true father-daughter relationship that really crosses time and space.Although the theme of ""love through time and space"" has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, so similar to our lives.Cooper does not have the ambition of ""my journey is the sea of stars"", but only wants to complete the task as soon as possible to return to her daughter to accompany her growth.In the autumn of human survival, Murphy's final choice of safe haven is still the place with the most memories of his father.",Interstellar
782,SangamYadagiri,General theory of relativity comes alive on screen,9/10,18 November 2014,"Interstellar is a movie worth watching only in large format theaters just for the experience. It's loosely based on the Einstein's General Theory of relativity - going into the black-hole travelling with the speed of light and navigating back and forth in time as one of the physical dimensions.Visually it is interesting to watch the theory of relativity come to reality on screen which is very impressive. It depicts the quantum physics near accurately. The fact that when an object/subject travels with the speed of light, it's original state or age is unaltered/slowed down - is shown convincingly. Apart from the science, the movie strongly revolves around the different Relationships among human beings especially the father daughter one. Matthew McConaughey's acting is very convincing in every scene.Graphics is something that is worth mentioning here. A new technique that has apparently been used in this movie. Normally the green screens have been used to shot the dramatic/action scenes with actors and the computer graphics were created later and then were super imposed. Even thought this technique is very effective as the computer graphic designers can design the graphics effectively according to the actors movements and the script, the actors should imagine the backgrounds which is quite difficult at times.But for this movie shooting, the background graphics were already generated and played in the studio while the actor can feel it and act naturally. The graphics to the viewer may not appeal but in this movie they were apt in the sense that -it's all about the light in the space which may be just white in color or monochromatic theoretically speaking. Narrative is very good with the age old technique of an old person starting to tell the story and the whole story run as a flashback.There have been many movies on the Sci-Fi genre released in the past such as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, Steven Spielberg's ET & Close encounters of the third kind, James Cameron's Avatar, Ridley Scott's Alien & Blade Runner, George Lucas's double trilogy Star Wars, and Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) but Christopher Nolan's Interstellar stands out in many aspects that have not been covered in the previous sci-fi movies that were made over the years.Personally, I still think Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made as it has some of the gigantic jump cuts starting from Rock ages to Space ages and concluding in a very convincing theory (Star Child) and the whole movie is a pure experience and allowing the viewer to immerse completely into movie and stop thinking about it. I regret not watching it in a theater especially a large format one. I would say my second favorite Sci-Fi movie is Interstellar.",Interstellar
783,TheOvereducated,"Such a bad, controversial film, that I had to review here too.",1/10,20 February 2020,"Where do I even start with reviewing this? I went to see this film in the cinema back in 2014, since I'm a fan of science fiction films. How could I have foreseen that it'll be such a ridiculous, long mess inside a shiny blender?3 hours, yet no character development. They were crying, but you didn't care. They were dying and you didn't care. But how could you care? We learned nothing about anyone other than McConaughey's character. The rest were there to either die or leave without us feeling distressed or caring at all. After all, for which character was the happy ending?Realism & Logic? Thrown out of the spaceship's window! A complete lack of expertise and professionalism from the 4 chosen astronauts. The 4 astronauts selected for the ""giant leap for mankind"" - the best people for the job - were learning the fundamentals of astrophysics (e.g. What is a black hole?) en route, inside the spaceship, outside of Saturn, with a whiteboard in a crash course! This does prove the ""scientific seriousness"" of the script, right? Sure! Oh yeah, they were also arguing over whether to go to the planet where one's boyfriend chills or to the statistically better one. Then, a not-supposed-to-be-hilarious cameo of another ""super astronaut chosen for the giant leap"" comes up and his actions are completely irrational. What about McConaughey's character's daughter, who wasn't talking to him from the ages of 5 to 28, because she was angry he had left because of work, yet one day she decides to send him a ridiculous message ""Hi dad. You son of a *****. ..."" and continue his work?! Lastly, I have to mention that ""Eureka!"" scene at the end... I am certain Archimedes slapped that actor backstage.As for the cinematography... 1998's Armageddon won! I never felt like I was in a big budget science fiction film about space and life in the distant future produced in 2014. I did like the depiction of the water planet, that whole scene kept me on the edge of my seat (let's exclude that illogically-designed ""super"" robot). But then, most of the time I was seeing the same, odd exterior side view of the spaceship supposed to depict the space flight. And then there were those Inception-like effects in another planet, where I only thought ""Heeey, that's from Inception, we're in a dream... a nightmare!"".Hans Zimmer, the music composer of the film, has made some masterpieces in the past. This is not one of them! Here, the music is simply annoying. A constant noise feedback, that is supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat.Conclusively, it should be obvious by now based on notable films, that the best way to get your message(s) across the audience is implicitly. Having to listen to frequent, shallow lines like McConaughey's character's ""Love surpasses any other power!"" or that ""Don't go gentle into that good night..."" every 15 minutes, I'm sorry, but the message, the meaning... my popcorn and everything is lost!I must admit it's annoying that the film is controversial and others find it an amazing film. This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And here, McConaughey is not likeable at all. It feels like he thinks way too much of himself and his acting. I miss his good, fun old days in movies like Fool's Gold (2008).
P.S. Did you realize, that at the end of the film McConaughey's character literally steals a spaceship from the ""spaceships' parking"" inside the bigger spaceship to go find a crew member at another planet? And that then the man in charge of the ""parking"" gets shocked as if someone just stole his bag of chips?!P.P.S. Intense, survival-threatening scene. The spaceship at high speed. An astronaut tells McConaughey's character what to do. And he replies, ""Say it, don't spray it."". What a humor! I wish that was the only one...P.P.P.S Don't get me started on the casting...!",Interstellar
784,surajpnair,The movie surpasses its own benchmark on multiple viewing,10/10,23 July 2019,"I have seen this movie couple of times in theatres and now it's convenient to watch it on digital platforms, In total, I have experienced this film more than 5 times and I must confess, the film grew on me every time more than my initial outings.
The science felt genuine, and it is so realistically presented. The concept of worm hole opening to a different galaxies and then exploring life in those galaxies is way futuristic and I believe with time we humans will get to that stage to understand beyond universe. To add, we have a special bond of father & daughter- so grounded, easy to relate to.
Every department be it casting, music, visualisation, dialogs, editing - everything is dealt with such precision by the filmmaker.
For me, this is one of the best works of Christopher Nolan. Brilliant envying piece of work indeed!",Interstellar

786,stevenfreekin,Interstellar was anything but STELLAR. It was more like Inter...Stupid.,3/10,23 December 2015,"After the underwhelming Dark Knight Rises, its director now brings us ""Interstellar."" Although it's an exceptionally photographed movie, it painfully lacks depth in its story and characters, which were all very forgettable. The only things i enjoyed about this movie were the production design, costume design, and visual effects. The music was one of the worst scores I've ever heard...WOW. Some parts of the movie are over dramatic to the point where its laughable.The characters were not believable. I was not convinced with Matthew McConaughey's performance as a NASA pilot at all. In terms of the story it was really, really, really stupid.Hmmmm....let's see. The world is going to end...What else is new. Let's find the best Nasa Pilot in the world. Great, we found a farmer who also happens to be the greatest NASA pilot in the world. Oh, by the way, it just happens that the spaceship is already built, equipped and ready to go with a crew. Awesome let's Go! Oh while on our mission let's tell the audience everything in exposition terms even the ones they heard about time travel from the past syfy movies again. Great. Let's also use a twilight zone twist with Matt Damon's character too. Awesome. Oh and let's have M. Night Shyamalan direct the ending with his signature twist. Great. Now let's loop it back to the beginning of the movie. WOW. Really, really, really Stupid.Unfortunately Nolan and Zimmer crap the sheets again like they did on the Dark Knight Rises.",Interstellar
787,Necroambulant,Lives Up To the Hype,10/10,12 May 2015,"I wanted to watch it a few times before finally formulating a coherent review of Interstellar. On its head, of course, it was one of the most visually stunning and brilliantly executed collection of special effects I've been fortunate enough to see in a movie. It's an exceedingly long movie and still packed to the brim with high concept science fiction and character study to the point that it feels like they might have shoved too much into it...so I wanted to really take a bit more time to mull it over before putting my opinion out here. The science behind even the more extreme elements of the movie is actually quite sound, at worst the filmmakers could be considered guilty of extrapolating a bit too far afield from the substrate of existing scientific knowledge and technological advancement...but that doesn't make for implausible narrative devices like those that exist in a lot of high concept science fiction. Also unlike a lot of high concept science fiction, this story is one that devotes a great deal of time to the characters and character development in response to intensely unusual and stressful situations. It certainly can't be said that the individuals populating the movie were in any way two dimensional, which was a refreshing thing to say the least. If you happened to enjoy movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey​, Gravity, and Sunshine, you are almost certainly going to enjoy this movie. There are clear elements that are either inspired by those works or at the very least serving as kindred spirit to aspects of those movies. Spoilers follow: The only part of the movie that I felt was a bit contrived and silly was the little pocket universe within the black hole that allowed for the protagonist to send messages back in time which served as the impetus behind the bulk of the narrative in between. Sadly, that same recursive element was predictable enough that I could see it coming from the moment the ""ghost"" was provided as a narrative device, the only thing I didn't have worked out was precisely how it was going to be achieved, until the black hole was referenced and it all became quite clear.",Interstellar

790,timmyhollywood,Falls short of greatness because of gimmicks,8/10,7 December 2014,"Interstellar is a great film. That's first and foremost. It's Olympic. But, once you're in the Olympics, you have to compete against the other Olympiads. You ought to be held in the highest esteem for the rest of your life for achieving that level in the first place, and then you compete for the gold medal. That's the way we are. We always look for more.Interstellar is (insert details about director and actors here). The film feels like an independent feature at the same time it sweeps with epic grandeur. It's beautiful. It's exciting. But I would stop short calling it a work of art.Kubrick's 2001 is a work of art. The reason I say that is simple. 2001 doesn't try to wrap things up in a neat little bow. 2001 ends as art. Art, in my humble opinion, approaches the inexplicable without the conceit of explaining it. Where Interstellar falls short of the gold is that it goes for the gimmick ending. I don't want to spoil it... Let's just say I liken it to Gravity, another amazing sci-fi movie that fell apart for me at the ending with the red baby shoes. (That film is old enough now that I feel comfortable with the spoiler.) She sees a dead guy, she thinks about the dead shoes, suddenly she knows how to get home and then she does and it's a happy ending. It does have its poetry and it's allegoric ministrations – how she floats like a fetus, how she takes her first woozy steps on land after her ""birth"" in the ocean back home – but it errs on the side of happy ending goo.Interstellar had a theoretical physicist consultant. The film charts the full-circle course. Of course, the theoretical physics needs to be dumbed-down for a big audience. So there's that. The plot mechanics surrounding the fourth dimension et al start to fall apart once you think of them. They wouldn't though, if the film took a different tack for the denouement.In 2001, Kier Dulla flies off into the great beyond. There is symbolism. There is magic. There is little that is explained. In Interstellar, the ending is peppered with sudden bursts of explication. Oh, this happened because(In case you didn't put it together yourself.) All of that magic, all of that build up is explained away by this ending exegesis and one pretty lousy ""twist"" gimmick.It's unfortunate. Perhaps William Blake is appropriate. ""When nations grow old, the arts grow cold, and commerce settles on every tree."" Kubrick wanted to retool filmmaking. He was an artist. Nolan may or may not be an artist, but Interstellar is a commercial film. There is nothing inherently wrong with this (Blake quote notwithstanding). It's just, for my taste, I want to be jettisoned off into that great beyond, left to wonder, left to feel the void, the abyss, the art. Not to be yanked back home by some watered-down theoretical physics that doesn't hold up too well under scrutiny.In fairness, it provokes some fun thinking and good debate possibilities. And it is, as a work of entertainment, a ton of fun. There are beautiful vistas and some really clever moments. It's a fun ride. It's an Olympic film, but I think it will be caught doping.",Interstellar
791,ThisIsWhyImScott,"Rage, Rage Against the Dying of the Light",10/10,3 May 2020,"The only movie to ever move me to tears, Interstellar turns theoretical physicist Kip Thorne's physics equations into mind-blowing visual effects in a heart-wrenching epic drama about interstellar travel, the survival of the human race, and a father-daughter relationship that transcends spacetime.

792,mb-155,One serious flaw,5/10,21 September 2015,"They spend a vast fortune on firms like this. They must spend so much more to get a big return than say a TV series like Star Trek or Stargate SG1 might so they should get all things right not some right and some wrong – yes? The new frontier stuff like seeing earth from a great distance and the end of the film were both ""far out"" and good. Yet not being able to hear the actors for most of the time is a crime that does not occur with a film like Gravity where the actor's voices are crystal clear.Even at the start we had issues; the three people in the SUV where did the son vanish to and driving back to the combine harvesters with a flat tyre. Not a brilliant start for a serious science fiction film as opposed to less serious science fiction like Edge of Tomorrow which was brilliant all the way through and yes you can hear the actors like Tom Cruise.Why do they always whisper that's not acting if you can't hear them. Matthew McConaughey may be a good actor but why talk in whispers against a background of loud music and sounds and the much more important computer graphics. Little wonder the android type computer says: ""Why are you whispering they can't hear you"".Maybe director Christopher Nolan encourages this as even Anne Hathaway sounded like she was in another room at times. Perhaps they should have use Matt Damon in the lead role because you can at least understand him. At least when he got angry I could hear McConaughey.But we stuck with this film like Starship Troopers even though travelling through the wormhole owes a lot to the TV series Stargate SG1 and yes we could hear Michael Caine.",Interstellar

795,peter_nilsson88,The 2001 of our time,10/10,5 April 2020,"Interstellar is a beautiful film with heavy focus on sound, music and visual effects. It takes you on an emotional journey and truly shows how the medium of film can be used as a form of art.Yes, the story is good, the actors are great, the ending plays with your imagination, and of course you can't help but compare it to ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" because there are so many similarities.I've seen Interstellar three times now and the time in the Cinema was by far the best. It's difficult to give this film full justice without maximizing the sound and music. Still it gets better every time I watch it, as a story and as the art that Interstellar is. A much watch, and one of the best Science-Fiction movies ever made!

796,samfischer88,One of My Favorites,10/10,11 February 2016,"Interstellar is one of my favorites. Everything about this was incredible. I personally thought Matthew McConaughey had a role of a lifetime. This was his best performance in my mind. Besides him, the other actors also performed fantastically. The cast was full of stars that really worked well together.The story could be a bit confusing at times but was complex and deep. There was a lot happening that really built up the suspense. Christopher Nolan has wrote some complicated plots before, and he did a great job of working with the complexity of this one. Each part is carefully laid out, allowing the viewer to gradually build into it. I loved the roller coaster ride all the way to the end! The end left me speechless. Just watch and see!The visuals are some of the best around as well. This fits perfectly with the Sci-Fi genre as an instant classic. I was mesmerized with how scenery and effects were presented from the start. I saw this in a great theater, so I got the full experience of the visuals. By the end you will be just watching in awe!When you put all this together, you get a great movie in Interstellar. This is one of my favorite movies ever. I would highly recommend this if you haven't seen it; 9/10.",Interstellar

Grand voyage into spacetime...,9/10,6 November 2014,"Just back from an unearthly experience, still trying to digest the thrill and cope up with the normal life again. Such powerful voyage in to the space! And in the end, in typical Nolan style, the movie gets so deep into your head and tries to mind-f*** you leaving you with an orgasmic awe!My head still resonates with the visuals and the questions Nolan has raised about human capabilities! How far can we really go in our quest for knowledge? What if we could explore the dimensions inaccessible to humans? And what the relativity of time could be in the real sense? We have just majorly heard about it in theories. . Or what would it like be going through a warm hole or getting trapped in the never- explained singularity of black hole?This is a grand journey, be ready to be mind-blown!Nolan proves it yet again, Visionary Cinema is his life!!!

798,pgaucher683,"a Milestone for Nolan brothers, do you know how love can be so powerful",10/10,25 May 2015,"I wanted to make a new review, my previous one was nothing but crapi've watched Interstellar 4 times already, i like the Nolan brothers, they are prolific, of course they have been influenced by others, but i don't think they are plagiarism period! from Memento to Inception or the best Batman's sequel ever made, they are simply great.I didn't like 2001 (S,Kubrick)for instance, but i absolutely loved Solaris with G,Clooney, Interstellar is the story of this single man who's living with his stepfather (john Lithgow) his children and love them as every father does, except Murph , they are connected together, more than with Tom who is really down to earth, Cooper was a NASA pilot and engineer once, now a farmer in a close future where Earth is dying, the 15 first minutes are about this father and his kids, chasing a drone to get some spare parts and it's really there that start a incredible journey, at this very moment , Hans Zimmer take the lead with one of the most beautiful and powerful score ever made for a Sci-Fi movie, the last time i've felt that , it was the one by Vangelis for Blade Runner,I've loved every second of this movie, Matthew McConaughey is outstanding so are the others, young Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) is incredible, she reminds me of Dakota Fanning who was one of the greatest child actors (I am Sam, War of the worlds, Man on Fire), they will discover together an anomaly which will lead them to a facility where Professor Brand (Sir Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway) try to save mankind, Cooper as an ex NASA pilot is very welcome but was it an accident, how did he found this place,? who told him? He will have to take one of his most important decision as a father, leaving Murphy and Tom who are young but also as a human being, fly a spaceship through a black hole to visit 3 worlds which could be the next planet for us,they spent 3 hours on the first world, (23 years on earth), imagine how Cooper feels, when is listening his messages, Murphy (Jessica Chastain), Tom (Casey Affleck) are adult now and it's absolutely brilliant, but they'll face a greater threat when they'll wake up professor Man (Matt Damon) and discover a terrible secret i will remember this film for ever , it's a masterpiece, one of the best movie ever, watch it as soon as you can",Interstellar
799,speedy-droid,It Has Been Far Too Long Since We Had a Great Space Epic,9/10,18 November 2014,"It has been 17 years since ""Contact"", the last great film about what might be ""Out There."" We've been teased with Interstellar for more than one year, and now the wait is over.In Four Words: I Was BLOWN AWAY!Although the film features many more space travel and other-worldly scenes than Contact did, it is the same type of story as Contact and that other great story, 2001: A Spaced Odyssey. Just as those two films were, the movie is not really about space travel -- It's about humans taking the next step in their physical, emotional, and spiritual evolution. There are quite a few technical inaccuracies in the spaceflight scenes, but this movie is not supposed to be a NASA Documentary. It's best just to let those details slide and concentrate instead on the story that is being told.Some audiences have complained about the loud soundtrack drowning out some the dialog. I was fortunate enough to see the film on the IMAX screen in Costa Rica, with Spanish subtitles (I can read Spanish), so this was not an issue for me. However, the soundtrack really, really, really MAKES this movie. When you buy the DVD next year, turn the subtitles on and crank up the volume. The music alone can bring you to tears.It is a bit of a tear-jerker, and the actors let the waterworks flow. The characters' reactions to being on a planet for little more than 3 hours, only to find out that 23 years have passed on their spaceship and on Earth, is heart-wrenching. Although the film gets dangerously close to it a couple of times, it always manages to fall just short of being overly-sappy or clichéd.The movie is not perfect. I personally found the scenes with Matt Damon's character to be a bit artificial and unbelievable, although I do understand that so many years alone could make a person a nonsensical lunatic. The character is a psychotic that somehow seems to be totally emotionless and lethally rational. It just didn't compute for me. Fortunately, this is a relatively brief portion of the film.I was ever so grateful to finally see a movie in which the robots weren't given stupid-sounding rhetoric and trite ""machine"" voices. The voice actors for the robots were given some awesome lines, too. ""What will happen if he opens the inner airlock?"" ""Nothing Good!"" The robots do have kind of a stupid-looking design, but their ability to adapt to many different physical tasks, as made quite evident on their first alien planet landfall, makes the purpose of their design very clear.This is outstanding quality film-making, that will surely easily speed past the $500 Million Gross Income mark and become this generation's ""2001.""If you do get a chance to see it in an IMAX cinema, I highly recommend it.",Interstellar
800,Matt-144-792009,Interstellar: Contemporary Space Odyssey,8/10,9 November 2014,"In Interstellar Christopher Nolan creates a breathtaking 70mm (the only way to see this movie) space epic. Starting Matthew McConaughey still riding high on the wave of the McConasaunce, as Cooper. McConaughey shows an even stronger emotional performance than the one that won him an Oscar in Dallas Buyers Club (2013). Just less of a physical transformation. Cooper is a father torn between his family and an opportunity to save the human race from destruction. This film is packed with A-list, top of their game actors who add icing to the cake on what is by itself a visually breathtaking movie. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, Michael Cane, John Lithgow and Casey Affleck to name a few. If you are a fan of Science Fiction this film is a must rush out an see, what are you waiting for, catch the next showing, movie. If you are not a fan of science fiction you might want to save this one for a rental. At 2 hours and 49 minutes, this film is a journey and investment that pays off greatly in the end. If you enjoyed last years Gravity (2013), you will like this just as much if not more. I am a huge fan of the late great director Stanley Kubrick. I have no doubt Christopher Nolan and his brother co-writter Jonathan Nolan belong to that same fan club. Interstellar is a contemporary 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). There are moments in Interstellar I longed to hear the beautifully orchestrated 2001 soundtrack to create that same emotion. So much to where after the movie I went home and immediately re-watched 2001. There is a comment made in Interstellar that the Apollo 11 space mission was faked, as an attempt to bankrupt the Soviet Union. Watch the documentary Room 237 (2012) and see what some people (myself included) think about Kubrick's role in the global ruse. 2001 was truly a film before its time. So why not have a new 2001; the year has come and gone. Interstellar is set in the future obviously, yet no actual date is ever mentioned. I assume so as not to date the material. The message in this space odyssey is much warmer than Kubrick's. Technology is no longer to be feared as in 2001. It is a companion, TARS the robot voiced by Bill Irwin is the exact opposite of HAL 9000; Helpful, funny, insightful and user friendly. Yet in appearance TARS is a cross between the 2001 monolith and a Transformer. The pressing need for environmental change and mankind's fear of extinction is the overall message. Its solution is much like that of the Beatles, all you need is love. Overall, not looking in too deep into all the plot points, and not getting too lost in the science of relativity and quantum physics; Interstellar delivers the best Science Fiction film this year.

I saw it in a large theatre when it was released and the soundtrack and the audio engineering was the best I've ever witnessed - not even close. The sounds were distorted and they were supposed to be that way. This is by far Hans Zimmer's best work in a movie IMHO. You have to see this with a good speaker setup because otherwise you are doing the movie a big disservice.Acting and casting is spectacular, and the story is riveting and emotional.I have seen this movie many times and always find something new to like about it.

803,1os4,Review,10/10,21 June 2020,"The best films by director Christopher Nolan. The film talks about physics on the importance of the family. The film was oppressed by the Oscars. He deserved the best actor and the best film and the best text and the best director for the film explorer. Until now, the film will show him the feelings in the film, O group, the second director was a great thing Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan Thank you for the film. Thank you Jonathan Nolan for the script. One of the best space

806,deltaforce7,A sci-fi fan dares to rate this LOW,1/10,1 April 2016,"This seemed like a complex, no basic entertainment-sort of a film-kind of experience. Should have been great as far as the concept goes. What I didn't like right away is the overall idea: IF there is a problem, then WALK AWAY. Meaning, the problem is never solved.Also. Complex concepts are displayed in a matter of a few fragmented shots. Even those who are used to the Sci-Fi genre are confused. But the rest are lost. What's nice are the certain technicalities. But the human, physical side is difficult, unexplained, overly politically correct and accompanied by other things that don't get a viewer anywhere near the point of all this.So, this could've been a real nice piece of a more intellectual sci-fi, but the makers of this movie got confused about how to depict such concepts.

807,philipposathina,Αs disappointing as it gets...,4/10,19 December 2016,"I know that Nolan's fans will disagree with me, but there is no chance that a real and experienced movie fan-or ""cinefil"" if you prefer - can find this cinematographic creation as interesting and magnificent as some of its viewers obviously lacking enough movie experience and knowledge may do. Let me start with a simple question: What is ""interstellar"" supposed to be? Science fiction? Excuse me but then its 95-99% pure fiction and only some little part of it science. Well i wouldn't mind it at all if a. it was not taking its ""scientific"" elements that serious, and/or b. It was using them for conveying some really original humanistic messages we had not already seen in a movie before. And that brings us to its supposedly tender and humanistic part: The father who has to sacrifice himself to save the world and his children and after a journey to the outer cosmos comes back to earth to find out that his present,future, and past are interconnected and that the short time his journey lasted counted as decades of earth years, so his beloved ones are either dead or dying over aged persons etc. etc... Did you find it touching? If yes, you should have found convincing the way the plot flows in the film. Have you? Well, i didn't at all. The strange events (f.ex the messages through the sand lines) and the arbitrary way they bring the ""father"" to the secret space center where he finds out that he is meant to fly the interstellar spacecraft, and then the arrival to the planets and the -scriptly redundant- adventures there, and then the... return to earth through the black hole and a multidimensional universe to a world where time (future-past-present) and space are all mixed... sorry i just couldn't buy it. And the thing is that in spite of the fact that i was not expected to either, the ""scientific"" information was there too, obviously as a pretext of how -wannabe- scientifically explained the whole story was... As about the humanistic/sentimental part, too flamboyant, too melodramatic,too banal: In ""Bicentennial Man"" Robin Williams had already seen his beloved ones aging and dying too. To make a long story short, i think than Nolan fell again in the trap of a too made up, too flamboyant, too ""i'll say everything in a single film"" style,too complicated, too wannabe impressive,unique and original script, involving a film that wanted to be the ""2001 space odyssey"" of our time, but it only said things we have already seen or heard in other films before,moreover through an overloaded script which meaning to say too much, made no sense at all in the end. It didn't capture my attention at all. For all the reasons i mentioned before, i found it overall unconvincing and therefore boring to death.",Interstellar
808,nick-sultana,A Truly Mesmerising Sc-Fi Film of 2014,10/10,9 November 2014,"When the name Christopher Nolan comes to mind, we think of Memento. The Prestige, Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy as films that changed, challenged and kept audiences in awe of what each of those films bring. But his latest offering is indeed not only up there with the best sci-fi themed films such as Inception, Gravity and 2001: A Space Odyssey (as it plays an inspiration for Interstellar along with other acclaimed science fiction classics) but one of the best and original pieces of film made this year.I'll try not to give too much away but the story is centered on a not too distant future where the Earth has become unsustainable for the human population; dust storms scour the land and mankind itself has reverted to crop farming for food but with little luck to boot. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is widowed and once was a NASA test pilot and engineer but resides now as a crop farmer alongside his teenage son Tom, younger daughter Murphy (or 'Murph' as her nickname) and father-in-law Donald. Murph believes that ghosts are trying to communicate her and they have given her coordinates of a possible location to discover, but it leads to secret NASA group lead by Professor Brand (Michael Cane) who theorizes that a possible wormhole discovered orbiting Saturn could lead to possible new worlds for human colonisation and asks for Cooper's help in leading the expedition along with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and 2 other NASA astronauts. The events that follow take off will lead to an adventure like no other that's visually spectacular, emotional and engaging.As said, Nolan has topped this works with this marvelous gem. Being based by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne's work, Nolan gives us the scenario of human life in another universe and taking 4 years to write the most realistic script alongside his brother Jonathan, the final result was indeed different to what I and others were expecting. The direction as always is spot on as already seen in his last films; he takes story seriously, pace is steady but never broken and characters are never wasted in his vision. The amount of time that was taken to be convinced on screen was a long journey for Nolan and his crew through financing, development, writing etc but the end result was indeed captivating and a step up in terms of science fiction in film.The casting and performances are all fantastic; these include Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Jessica Chastain and a surprising appearance of another one (but I won't be revealing this).The supporting talents of Wes Bentley, Topher Grace, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck and the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart are all . McConaughey in particular has amped up his acting roles since his role in The Lincoln Lawyer and only this year won best actor for Dallas Buyers Club, he gives not only a realistic depiction of man losing not only his reason for existence but yet redeem it all for the sake of mankind, but he conveys emotion, hope and yet convincing enough to be the film's hero. Hathaway similarly does this as well with excellence and has driven herself to be involved in captivating films since Les Miserables, expanding her acting range. The topping performance of all (in my opinion ) was Jessica Chastain, since seeing Zero Dark Thirty she can be incredible in drama driven roles and breathing life into her characters so I'm betting she will get Oscar attention alongside McConaughey and Hathaway.Music here is incredibly captivating and who else to deliver this is award winning and highly acclaimed composer Hans Zimmer (a favorite of mine to listen to). To describe Intersellar's score, Zimmer says that ""The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are probably in the bin"" and like '2001' the music is beautiful and plays a role in the story's emotion. Visual effects here are becoming more CGI than practical but Nolan highly prefers the practical magic and minor CGI to bring the realistic effect. The use of miniature effects, built and designed sets and production are all in for Oscar worthy attention, and this was possible because of visual effects team Double Negative.Overall, Interstellar is a captivating, engaging and emotional film release of the year and only a year after 'Gravity' had changed the mold on science fiction, but Interstellar adds more with its concept, cast, music and atmosphere that creates a beautiful journey to the unknown that will indeed earn Oscars wins in the next awards season.",Interstellar
809,samadabbasi,Interstellar!,10/10,14 November 2014,"The movie was great. As a matter of fact Nolan's movies are always great but as this was his first complete Sci-Fi movie, it was an amazing experience, as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done, the director's ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies. ""Interstellar"" is another one of Christopher Nolan's more personal mind-blowing movies.That said, just about everyone so far seems to agree that Interstellar is worth seeing in the biggest format possible, for the visuals alone. It was visually stunning and the cast did great. The Oscar winning actor Matthew McConaughey played the leading role wonderfully.It's surely worth seeing on big screen. You should go see it too. ;)

810,waelkatkhuda,Gravity is still the best sci-Fic of all time,1/10,10 November 2014,"first of all i'm happy that the film wasn't number one at the box office and that's for a simple reason it didn't deserve it. I went last Friday to see this film for two reasons : first i like Nolan's films specially Inspection, and second reason is because i thought i'm gonna see a film like or even better than Gravity, but it wasn't. as the matter of fact it was the worst film i have ever seen for years and that's for many reasons: 1- the graphic design was OK, but not like Gravity gravity was much real as if u were in the space with them 2-the story is very long unreasonable ( specially the end) and confusing because once u are in space and once u are in earth i really wanted to leave the theater but i because i paid the ticket i refused to go out. and i the end all i wanted is to( get my money back )",Interstellar
811,dplowsav,A Over-hyped Imperfect Movie...,3/10,9 November 2014,"Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either.It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, ""Shut up already and get on with it!"" Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well.Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange.By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad.If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from.The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation.Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem.When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen.Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one.",Interstellar
812,richard-810,Nolans 'not quite' 2001,6/10,2 April 2015,"This movie has achieved a very high rating on IMDb and so I had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great.",Interstellar
813,ericaharris1908,Ridiculous,1/10,3 May 2015,"This was beyond stupid. Boring. Nonsensical.Not entertaining in the least. You would have to have zero brain cells to think this movie was good. Really? One of the greatest, NOT! The plot was beyond stupid and preposterous storyline. I like fantasy and sci-fi but this turkey of a movie was beyond belief. There are never any explanations about anything. Humanity is on the edge of destruction, they have advanced cryo-sleep technology but have old beat up cars and old tvs, where exactly were they getting gas? So what happened to the food source, how the blithe came to be? The 'science' was so beyond ridiculous it completely ruined any real sense of danger. The characters were boring and I did not care for any of them. Frankly most of the characters were pretty annoying. Laws of gravity,mathematics, space time..who needs them. The mark of of good story telling us the ability to make the impossible seem possible. People in cryo-sleep for several years just wake up, no disoriention, problems ambulating...really? The scenery was boring and bland a water world and rock world. No signs of life. My head is hurting. Don't bother with this dud.",Interstellar

815,ravs05,2hr 45min of Perfection!!!,10/10,12 March 2018,"I wanted to write a review for so long, but had to take my time to come up with the right words. I am doing this partly for self-preservation but mainly due to the sheer brilliance which the film offers. I am very happy to be able to witness this masterpiece and sad at the same time knowing that we might have to wait long to witness another film like Interstellar.My obsession started almost 12 years ago, when Interstellar was listed on Steven Spielberg's filmography with a synopsis saying exploring Wormholes, Time-Dilation, Interstellar travel and everything else which Kip Thorne's theories explores! I was watching this space like a hawk, only it never moved past that one dedicated page on IMDB. Almost 12 years later, Spielberg opts out and Christopher Nolan steps in and the project kicks off. I was actually surprised on how quickly they pulled this off. Stuck in development for over a decade and then gets completed in just a year, that is amazing speed. However, I was a bit sceptical especially after reading the leaked script on IMDB which included Chinese robots on far abandoned planet with gravity controlling devices, etc. it seemed like containing strong doses of sci-fi and less of the theories which could be possible one day. But thank god, the script was just a decoy and the movie takes the right direction. It brilliantly explores the possibilities of interstellar travel at the same time keeping the nature and relationships which human's share at its core. Now that is quite the balance and with such complex script, if done wrongly, this movie could have been a disaster. But Christopher Nolan helms this with utter confidence and brings in the master composer, Hans Zimmer on board. Zimmer delivers the most brilliant and original score which perfectly gels with every scene, every sentence spoken and every silent and non-silent moment. It's really a shame that this man did not win an Oscar since Lion King even after being nominated for gems like Sherlock Holmes, Inception and Dunkirk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job for Interstellar. I really want Nolan and Zimmer to make Interstellar 2!!Coming to the movie, I really don't want to talk about the plot as this is done in every other piece written about this movie, instead I would like to state why I was in awe for the entire run-time. I always was a huge fan of science-fiction, both ""Star Wars"" kind and ""Contact"" kind. There is always something fascinating about not just mentally visualising but actually seeing things which probably are not going to be possible in our lifetime. Travelling through a worm-hole and entering another galaxy is right on top of that list. And this film does that so brilliantly that there is no room for wanting more. Kip Thorne's presence as a scientific adviser solidifies the liberties which the film can take. So Interstellar has the right doses of science and science-fiction blended together. Time-Dilation was another concept which I eager to see after watching an episode of Brian Cox explaining theory of relativity. This is brilliantly portrayed in the film when the team visits Miller's planet. An hour there equals 7 Earth years. Wow, scientists must have lost their minds when Einstein stated and verified this theory in 1905!! Another thing which Interstellar and many other films take for granted and show simplistically are the hibernation pods. Sleeping and waking up in one piece after decades/centuries opens up so many wonderful possibilities. Wish that was as simple and real as these films portray. I know we just perfected the ""Sleeping"" bit but the waking up process if for future mankind. Wish we could get there sooner.And then the epic Event Horizon and Singularity. This is where the films takes its liberties for dramatisation purposes. Still it is exciting visualising time as a physical dimension and being able to scroll through one's time-line as if it was the songs list on our iPhones!So Interstellar satisfies all our wildest space-exploration dreams, in the most realistic way possible and for this reason alone, this film will be number one spot on my list! Coming to the cast, everyone fits like a glove to the script. I loved Matthew McConaughey in Contact and he does the same brilliant job here as well, bringing all his on-screen charisma. Other noteworthy mentions are Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, they played their parts to utmost perfection. And Of-course Mackenzie Foy, who played the younger role of Murph with finesse. Finally, this movie is as good as realistic sci-fi gets and we might have to probably wait for a long time to witness another epic like this. Sigh!!",Interstellar
816,j-00900,An exciting movie,9/10,2 June 2020,"I want to give 100 stars, which is probably the most shocking movie I've ever seen. By the end of the movie, we are still crying. The miracle is not because there is God or some unknown power. It is ourselves. Humans do not believe in human power. We think that those unpredictable miracles are attributed to God.

It made sense the first time I watched it, but it was just to confusing to enjoy. But when you rewatch it, everything makes sense and I love it.

818,tim_dearing-1,A film that is already a monument to the art.,10/10,25 May 2015,"I don't watch film review programs and I don't buy magazines about the movies. Whilst doing the weekly shop, I like many I'm sure, always like to peruse the shelves for new releases as a treat for the weekend.On the shelf was Interstellar. I read the jacket, saw who was in it, and thought it might make for a decent Sunday afternoon movie.I was and indeed remain completely astonished. This film is a true giant. First of all, it's nearly three hours long and I didn't realise until it was over and I looked to see what the time was. It went by so fast and at no time did I think ""I wonder how much time it's got to go?"" Secondly I didn't want it to end.Without spoiling it, the story in very brief is that the Earth is dying. There is a dirt that sweeps across the globe in dust like storms making growing anything almost impossible with the exception of a number of staple foods. But these are becoming less and less. Society seems to be carrying on, but certainly in a much smaller way than now. I don't believe any explanation was offered as to why this had come about. Most of the World has regressed to a way of life devoted to the growing of food crops to sustain itself.There is a major reason why it is decided to leave the planet to find somewhere else to live, but I do not want to reveal the reasons or how they manage it for the sake of ruining it for viewers who have yet to see it.So what it comes down to is the story, plot line, acting and its ability to seem real. Can I reassure you that the story is first class, things that did not need to be said - for instance as I suggested earlier the reason why the Earth became what it now is - are indeed omitted. It is not necessary to provide that back story. Its inclusion was not required. The plot line with its tension and excitement - and trust me, there is excitement and tension aplenty - are perfectly executed. The acting is of the very highest order. It would be easy to point to Matthew McConaughey and say how incredible his performance was - and it was - but that would be to belittle the others who appear alongside him. It's a team effort.It draws you in, takes you on a ride that bewilders and astonishes whilst remaining deep and thought provoking.Also, credit where credit is due, the Hans Zimmer soundtrack is huge. By huge I mean that when it is required, the music enhances the experience enormously. It is a music befitting this giant of a movie and indeed stands out itself as work of genius.I may seem to be going completely over the top, and perhaps I am, because not everyone will share my sense of wonder of this film. But, as those oh so rare movies that have come before it, it is an instant monument to the art of film making.I give this film my highest accolade.",Interstellar
819,soupster1,I Had To Stop Watching...,1/10,21 January 2015,"It starts off with a farmer (Independence Day style), and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because... well... we're not really sure why, but it involves a lot of wind.Then NASA gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of 'space' that comes complete with bad paintings of old 'hubble' pictures, lots of 'space' type language... and gravity. The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole. They get through the black hole (like that's possible), by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys.The robots look and act like corn flake boxes, the humans (mostly well known), look bemused... and at that point... I had to stop watching. I was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke... but it wasn't.I don't like ranting, so I won't. Suffice to say that if the Earth has to end... at least let it explode before Hollywood can make another 'turkey' like this.Embarrassingly bad.",Interstellar
820,rajivness,Stupid movie that plods along. Confused,5/10,6 December 2014,"I had huge expectations of this movie. But this movie wastes the audience's time. its frickin 3 hours long!!! It wastes too much screen time in getting to the point and focuses far too much time on the rural life of Cooper (McConaughey's character) and his relationship with his two children. Furthermore this movie makes illogical leaps that don't make any sense and are frankly annoying.Here's one: Food crisis on earth. So, instead of figuring out ways to grow weather resistant crops or hydroponics or anything like that - they make the leap of completely abandoning ship to the extent of finding another planet to live on! The science is interesting - about traveling through a rift in space - time (worm hole) to travel to other galaxies to explore viable alternatives to planet earth. Going into a deep frozen sleep of sorts (similar to the original Alien) to preserve the body for the long interstellar travel.The movie uses the idea of time travel in a way that the future and past co-exist together and impact each other - like - Murph's Morse code warnings that suggested Cooper shouldn't have embarked on the mission to begin with.This movie is about coming full circle and realizing that you shouldn't have done anything at all. Yea.. i know. Not very inspiring.The movie isn't very original either borrowing concepts from already released and icon scifi movie and television like Star Trek, Alien, Carl Sagan's Cosmos, Back to the Future, etc. to name a few.",Interstellar
821,Wrapper30,The Emperor's New Clothes,3/10,24 November 2014,"I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.",Interstellar
822,db-beurylaw,"If this is how humanity is to be saved, we are doomed",2/10,15 November 2014,"This is stupid. Stupid, stupid stupid!!! And boring. I want to congratulate reviewer melkurion and incorporate his or her well written review. I wish he or she had written the script. If you like stupid movies that make no sense, I suggest you get a copy of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" another amazing insult to your intelligence. At least ""Voyage"" was fun to watch for the mere stupidity. This one is simply extremely boring. The first 45 minutes is Mathew McConaughey as a single father talking to his daughter? You can go to any park on Saturday afternoon and see the single fathers talking to their kids and it will be far more entertaining. Then Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles into a super-secret NASA installation, not in Florida mind you, but apparently in a corn field in Iowa. He is immediately snapped up to pilot the last remaining space ship on a dying planet. He has to save the earth from a dust storm. The angst is that he has to leave his daughter and it might be a few hundred years before he gets back. Here's the reason I write: NASA is sending its last space ship, its only hope to save our species, with a pilot they just met, two other guys and one woman. Huh? If you're going out to find another habitable planet, and chances are the people sent are never coming back, and you send one woman? The writers do know where babies come from, don't they? Anne Hathaway plays ""Brand"" and is the only woman on board. What if she gets killed? What if she is infertile or not very good at getting pregnant? The entire future of the human race is riding on her. She is 32 years old and looks older. They would have been better off leaving Cooper at home and sending his daughter. Any reasonable effort to save the human race would have been to send three young women, one viral young man and a whole lot of frozen sperm. The reason that there is just Hathaway is because of the movie convention that we must always have more dudes. Always. Even if the situation calls for women, even if it only makes sense that the participants be female, there must be mostly men. And director here fell back on the cliché from SI-Fi movies of the 50s: Why is there a chick in the space ship at all? Because she is the daughter of the Professor who is masterminding the project. If the professor didn't have a daughter, they would be all dudes in the space ship. Brand couldn't be accomplished on her own? She gets to be in the space ship because she's the daughter. The science may have come a long way from the 50s, but the male dominated film industry has not. As I said the whole movie made no sense and is an insult to your intelligence. Add in the chauvinism and you got a fun night out.",Interstellar
823,mitcherator777,Wonderful Journey to the other side of the Universe,10/10,8 November 2014,"I am truly blown away by every minute of this movie, There are great science fiction movies, and then there are true masterpieces of science fiction. I would put this in a Masterpiece, it is one of my top five science fiction movies i love.There are not enough words to describe a masterpiece, yet something must be said of it: Let's just say it is about the survival of the human race & potential solution. The movie is based off a Book that Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne wrote, it is a story based off the most fascinating subject in all of science fiction; i.e. Black holes.I don't want to give away the plot other than say GO SEE THE MOVIE. IT is as good as they say it is.

824,yvonneshusband,Should be titled Star Trek: Interstellar!,7/10,22 February 2017,"Due to the legion (apparently!) of cinematic (and televisual) ignoramuses who insist that each successive Nolan movie is a greater masterpiece than the previous one, the more educated viewer is required to treat popular (and no small amount of critical) opinion on Nolan's films with scepticism. 'Interstellar' is a case in point. Cutting to the chase: (a) An artificial wormhole that leads from our part of the Galaxy to the other side is straight out of 'Deep Space Nine'. (b) Love as 'wormhole' connecting us with events in our past; again straight from the premiere of DS9. Arguably, the stunning DS9 episode 'The Visitor' examines this same idea to even greater effect. (c) A more advanced form of life intervening in the development of a less advanced one, possibly due to the former having evolved from the latter: DS9 again. (d) Using 'technobabble' to reduce the 'inertial mass' of a space station so that it can be moved closer to the wormhole: DS9 again. (e) Baseball is Benjamin Sisko's favorite sport; the game features in multiple episodes of the show. Although the baseball breaking the window of the house on the space station wall is a beautiful touch! To be sure, 'Interstellar' doesn't confine its 'borrowing' to 'Star Trek'; the explanation of how a wormhole works is lifted directly from 'Event Horizon'. The ending is reminiscent of the 60s movie 'The Time Machine'. Bottom line: like most sci-fi movies, it's neither startlingly original nor deeply philosophical. In fact, the TV show it 'borrows' so freely from did a far better job of presenting the idea that 'love...transcends time and space' than Nolan does here (Anne Hathaway giving what must surely rank as one of her worst performances ever, to boot). If that example of how the 'great' Christopher Nolan couldn't rise above the directorial standards of a TV show isn't bad enough, the execution of the movie's 'celestial temple' sequence, where Cooper communicates with Murph across time, must surely demonstrate to anyone but the most fanatical Nolanite how poorly Nolan ranks as an employer of visual storytelling; the presentation of multiple instances in the timeline of the room could have, and with a better director would have, allowed the audience to infer that the spiritual connection between Cooper and his loved ones was acting as the 'bridge' between him and Murph without Cooper having to baldly say so! This could have been achieved (and this is only one example!) by presenting more of the room's timeline through shots of the earlier stages in the daughter's life, with her mother as an infant, as a toddler with Cooper and her older brother, etc. Interestingly, for a film that asserts that 'love...transcends time and space', none of the characters have any photographs of their departed loved ones! Of course, maybe Nolan simply underestimates the intelligence of his audience and therefore feels it necessary to 'tell' them what's going on instead of 'showing' them, ironic considering how Nolanites consider themselves to be on a higher intellectual level than the average moviegoer. This movie goes absolutely nowhere that other sci-fi movies or TV shows haven't already gone before.",Interstellar
825,rsabnis1,"Interstellar : More than a director, it is made by a DREAMER",8/10,12 January 2015,"Christopher Nolan's comprehensive Weltanschauung ( conception of universe and human's analogy to it ) Interstellar is his most endearing, audacious and expertly scripted venture. A script which once was developed by Jonathan Nolan for Steven Spielberg finally ended in the helms of his brother Chris. A sheer ocular pleasure, when viewed on 75 mm screen, this movie based intergalactic space voyage smells of ambition, emotion and beauty. The viewer doesn't needs to suspend his incredulity inspite of the film being a piece of fiction, owing to the fact that it is one of Nolan's strongest narrative.An enthralling and distinct start to movie reminding us of social documentaries which pictures blight-induced earth as a dust bowl with last shades of humanity left, earth has become inhabitable over time with increasing crop failure and frequent dust storms. Amidst the scenario comes Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed engineer-turned- pilot-turned-farmer who is prompted by some ghostly forces ( who send coded messages) to visit NASA facility in the outskirts of his village. The facility led by Dr John Brand (Micheal Caine) reveals Cooper about a secret mission in search of a habitable planet beyond the solar system and he asks Cooper to pilot the space ark 'Endurance' with the team. Devastated at the thought of her father leaving her, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is filled with discontent and hatred for him.The film tracks Cooper's odyssey along with the NASA team and two robots CASE and TARS as they travel through the wormholes to discover a sustainable living environment while Dr Brand and grown- up Murph (Jessica Chastain) try and solve the inevitable problem of gravity. The direction is accurate and film balances well between different time zones as Cooper and his accomplices verge many light years ahead.Unavoidable comparisons with Gravity and 2001: a Space Odyssey, Interstellar thinks more about the future than focusing all its attention on the present and past. A graphically rich special effects packaged with a mammoth script which reflects a large time devoted to research and a great casting, Interstellar might be specious and flawed at places but it doesn't stop the movie from being a winner.8 on 10 stars",Interstellar
826,smg242,A beautiful venture into the final frontier.,9/10,16 November 2014,"There is a lot that can be spoiled about this movie, so I'm going to keep this one short and just share my opinion about the more than its content (This again goes to show why Chris Nolan keeps so much secrecy about his movies).On the outside, Interstellar is about some people who go to space. Of course, on the inside, it is a much more complex plot, but a simple story.This is by far the greatest-looking movies ever. The visuals are so impressive, you will feel you're on a space ride in an amusement park. This entire movie in itself is one huge ride through the cosmos, frequently going back and forth from Earth and space, as one huge story.The movie is long, but like good long movies, there is a lot happening, so it is never boring. The cast is great, their performances superb, and Hans Zimmer's music is on par, if not better, than his music from the Dark Knight Trilogy (so it's REALLY GOOD).I can see why some critics didn't like the movie much because of its overt sentimentality and flaws with respect to the human story going on throughout. I personally thought these kind of flaws were definitely there, but they weren't much of a big deal. Not as much as Anne Hathaway's hair, anyway (OK that was a bad joke from my side).Go see it, it's beautiful. A bit too sentimental, like the critics have said, but with a lot of redeeming qualities. Not Nolan's best writing work, but definitely a great directorial work of art.",Interstellar
827,cosmicfish14,"For Every High, There's A Low",9/10,8 November 2014,"This was probably the strangest movie I saw this year for me. The reason is that, for every moment that was amazing and had a lot of impact, there was also and incredibly mind boggling scene or plot point thrown into the mix. But I'll go into more depth about that later. So, whats the story of Interstellar? The story is that the world is kinda bad now, since there dust-storms happening all the time, the only food Earth can produce now is corn. So an engineer played by Mathew Mcconaughey is sent by NASA on a space exploration mission to find another planet that is more habitable. But the engineer still has a family and has to say good bye to them before his big expedition. He then travels through other galaxies with other characters, one played by Anne Hathaway and a robot named TARS who kinda looks like Hal 9000 if he could walk. Well that's just the basic story anyway. If I told anymore it would just be a spoiler. First lets talk about the good things. The acting in this movie is really good, everyone seemed to play there parts well. for the most part. There were some emotional scenes that were done incredibly well with the acting and how it was shot. That's another thing, the movie was shot incredibly well. There were some scenes in the movie that reminded me of Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey with the cinematography. The soundtrack also helped create an amazing atmosphere of outer space. Again, reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now the best thing about the movie for me was the special effects. Oh my gosh, these effects were amazing. There were so many scenes that helped build the atmosphere of the planets the characters went to, so much so that I felt like they were really on a different planet and not some green screen over some random set. The use of practical effects were also done beautifully. The scene where they were flying the little ship felt like they were really flying. That was all my positive thoughts on the movie, so now time for the bad. But first..Warning: This section of the review will contain spoilers. If you don't want to be spoiled about this movie then just scroll down the dash away from this review.First off, the characters go to a planet that's made entirely out of water. After a while they notice that this planet can create gigantic waves the size of buildings. When they got there 3 characters that came to this planet, Mathew, Anne Hathaway, and character who only had 3 line up to this point. Gee, I wonder if there's someone who's going to die? Of course the guy who I'm not even sure if they mentioned his name, dies. After that they just go back to the station. It seemed like there was no point to going to that planet besides have an expendable character die and not even have it advance the plot in anyway. Then the biggest problem with this movie is in the last third of the movie. So the protagonists arrive on a snowy type planet, where they meet a surviving astronaut played by Matt Damon. When I first saw this movie I thought, 'Let me guess, hes going to act like a friend but then betray them for some dumb reason and also for the sake of having another sub plot in a Christopher Nolan movie.' And guess what, he does just that! It then leads up to a scene where Matt Damon is trying to go into the space station, and the pacing makes this scene fell like it going on for 20 minutes. And for no reason at all an asteroid randomly hit Matt Damon's ship out of sheer convenience, and I almost burst out laughing. Then Mathew has to go into a black hole for some reason that I can't remember well. Then whats happens next is so freaking confusing and strange that you need to see this scene for you're self because of how confusing it is. And people thought Inception was hard to follow. And I'm still not sure if it had some scientific relevance or if it was just a Deus Ex Machina disguised as something complex. Also the entire ending is just one big giant convenient ending because this movie is already almost 3 hours long.Final Thoughts: Even though there were a lot of great things about this movie, there also so many bad things about this movie. I feel like it is still worth seeing for the good acting and special effects but it won't hide some of the inconsistency's of the movie. And this may be the only time I have been completely split down the middle about my opinion about the movie. Which is why I'm interested what everyone else thought about the movie Final Rating: 5.8/10",Interstellar
828,AkelaLoneWolf,Movie of the Year,9/10,16 November 2014,"Nolan is undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our times; his masterpieces have sparked a number of similar (though all inferior) works and he has inspired (and will continue to inspire) generations of talents. The worshippers of cult flicks will remember him for ""Memento"", the mind psyche group will revere ""Inception"", while I believe he will establish his place in the cinematographic hall of fame with his Batman series and this movie - Interstellar. The world described here is a bleak barren land going through a global scale of desertification. Mankind has been reduced to pathetic beings facing famine and starvation as a constant threat. Dreams and aspirations are luxuries and the dreary daily battle with dust and sandstorms as well as dwindling agricultural produce make this a drawn-out version of living hell. Our chief protagonist is an explorer and adventurer who, like a fish out of water in his present existence, jumped at the one chance of saving the world by doing what he does best. As expected, this turns out to be an introspective and revealing odyssey putting humanity to the test. Thanks to the almost-too-smooth twist of the plot, the ending was brighter than what we thought it would be. Do not miss TARS the robot - providing the necessary mirth to dissipate the doom and gloom that might otherwise haunt the movie. The concepts of relativity, black holes, wormholes, 5-dimensional existence, etc. are quite well explained thus digging up physics textbooks are superfluous. This is quite definitely the 2014 film of the year (with only two remaining months to go). Highly recommended.",Interstellar
829,keithbet,Epic fail 101,3/10,16 June 2015,"Interstellar was not on my 'to watch list' as Nolan has impressed with just one title - Inception; which had a great cast and the flimsy plot was overshadowed by DiCaprios usually solid performance.Interstellar was a dismal failure. Yet again the Nolan bros try to 'Einstein' the plot with such annoying irregularities one eventually stops caring much and instead watch the CGI. Mat McC' and his Batman voice impersonation was annoying. Matt Damon and his brief appearance was out of place. The characters did not gel. Overly long and a ridiculously rushed ending, after an agonizing drip start to the film, that was far to intelligent for its own good.A +2 hour SNL skit by a pretentious director and scripted with a dose of equally pretentious sibling.

I liked Gravity and if this came from the same director, I would have ranked it higher than gravity, but from Nolan? If you are a film freak like me, I would still stay to go out to the theater, it is different and a nice movie, but not of Nolan's class. Period.

835,jaskunwar993,A Philosophical Revelation with Scientific Rationality makes this my Greatest Film-Watching Experience Ever,10/10,7 November 2014,"It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined. Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways.I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw. Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect. Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about.For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it.A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond.***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. ""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground.This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow.",Interstellar
836,Sruthi_Me,Intense!!!!,10/10,9 November 2014,"There is only one word to describe Interstellar and that is intense. Oh my god, a movie like no other. It's been around 3 hours since the movie ended and I am still reeling from it, desperately trying to hang on to the little shred of sanity I have left in me.Based on the rave reviews it received, the ridiculously high IMDb ratings and of course the fact that all most all the theaters were pretty much completely prebooked, I decided to pick this over Big Hero 6 this weekend.and that is probably one of the best decisions I have made (in all fairness I do not know how big hero 6 is, but still). So, the movie starts off like any other normal sci - fi Hollywood drama, you know, a little slow, with a lot of big words and explanation. However, you might want to pay attention to the first half as it sets the base for the second. The second part starts and seems to go on forever. From the first appearance of Matt Damon till the end of the movie, you are thrown into a mixture of emotions and slowly start losing the grasp on reality. Amazing direction, screenplay, acting coupled with some brilliant background scores sets this movie on the path to wining a couple of Oscars hands down. Bottom line - a must watch for sure. However, ensure that you have some Tom and Jerry stored on your laptop that you can come back to.",Interstellar

My boy and I left the theater blinking and scratching our heads over the loose ends and the heavy slathering of deep inner meaning which, unfortunately, proved largely incomprehensible for our plebeian minds. Oh well. The similarities to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" were embarrassing at some points, although I assume most current movie goers have not seen this 46-year-old film. Throughout Interstellar, there was a lot of weepy overacting in various attempts to dramatize the effects of relativity on time and the resulting differences in human aging. Then there was the subtle, underlying message that humans are the gods who will rescue humanity. I prefer the capital-g God as my rescuer, thank you. This film was a special-effects extravaganza, but, ultimately, pretty lame.",Interstellar
838,BecauseIAmBATMAN,A Magnificent Journey through Space and Time,9/10,8 November 2014,"WOW....This is a film I have been quite anticipating for over an year. My expectations were incredibly high, I was nervous I might end up being disappointed and yet Interstellar was everything I could dream of and much more.Its an ambitious science fiction, an exhilarating ride with a strong emotional punch. Enter this post apocalyptic world where Earth is full of dust and dying, where the only option for Mankind to survive is to leave Earth. This film feels similar yet is quite different from previous films by Christopher Nolan. The actors have done a very good job expressing their emotions. Special kudos to 13 year old Mackenzie Foy, as she did a hell of job emoting her feelings of not being able to see her father again, I almost cried. Music from Hans Zimmer worked pretty well and gives an epic and haunting feel in the film.This film takes quite a lot of inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially in the visuals department. The visuals are quite imaginative and creative. The trip through the wormhole for one is mind blowing. The third act of this film might be polarizing and somewhat crazy. You will either love it(not revealing why because its a Spoiler) or hate it as it didn't make much sense to you. I ended up being blown away by it. This film also provides an accurate representation of the Time dilation and the general theory of relativity, one of the primary reasons I loved it.But I wouldn't call this film flawless. Nolan uses the cross cutting technique pretty much like his previous films, while it worked smoothly in Inception and Prestige but it feels disjointed in this film. There are some annoying plot points which might irk you. One of my biggest gripe was I couldn't see it in IMAX, hence I cannot truly appreciate the beauty of this film. But that being said this film is set to awe and inspire audiences. Its an emotional roller coaster ride which you mustn't miss. 9.5/10",Interstellar

840,reoroy,Yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan,10/10,8 November 2014,"Watching any Christopher Nolan movie is the experience of a lifetime and Interstellar is no different. Nolan has this innate ability to transform his visions into spell-binding cinema and a movie like ""Interstellar"" will make you want to know more about the beauty of the quantum theory. The film starts off on a very promising note and by the time the movie ends, it will knock you off your feet. That's obvious. It's a Christopher Nolan movie after all. There are various moments in this movie during which you might actually want to stand up on your seat and start clapping ( I'm not going to mention which scenes). In terms of scale and grandeur this movie seemed to be a notch better than Nolan's other movies.""Interstellar"" has a magnificent star cast and Matthew McConnaughey, who plays Cooper in this movie, is on a roll. He won an Oscar for his performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" earlier this year and he also did a marvelous job in ""True Detective"". Considering how he has acted in ""Interstellar"", he is on the verge of winning an Oscar all over again. All the other actors and all the actresses have given lovely performances but this movie is like a gift from Christopher Nolan to Matthew McConnaughey. He overshadows almost every actor in this movie in terms of performance. His chemistry with his on-screen daughter Murph played by Mackenzie Foy, is adorable. The background score has been composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer and this movie might not have been as good as it is had it not been for his music. He is bound to be awarded for the kind of work he has done for this movie.Christopher Nolan has a tremendous eye for detail and you will notice this when you see the movie. To call Nolan a ""genius"" director would be an understatement. He is God's gift to mankind. And as long as this man stays on Earth, I'm sure he will be responsible for many more extravaganzas in the years to come.",Interstellar
841,clearwinner,Do not read the review just go and enjoy this MASTERPIECE,9/10,7 November 2014,"Well we all know about Christopher Nolan so it would be just a waste of your time telling how wonderful the movie was.a)Great Story b)Great Narratioin or the turn up of events c)Simple to follow d)Breathtaking Visuals e)Mesmerising Music f)Great Actors.. I can go on and on....This movie is for audience. YOu have a little family drama, a suspense, trill, humor, SCI-FI, action, adventure.... I mean it is a whole package. I loved the scene where they land on the water planet and the waves come... Seriously what a shot that was. Just I did not like the end, I was expecting a more complicated sort of end like the inception, and that would have seriously added a magic touch to the film. It should not have been a happy ending as it happens.Anyways just go and watch the movie, even if you do not understand anything the visuals are worth the money. It's a pity that where I watched the movie the room had just 15 members out of the 200 strength there, well they are just happy watching Indian flicks.",Interstellar
842,sudhirkumarpal8,Terrific,8/10,27 September 2021,"Can't say which aspect of the movie I like the most. I mean everything of this movie was amazing and hard to tell which one was the superior.Starting with the ultimate fantasy of reaching another galaxy altogether is close to mind-blowing, whatever was left that wormhole thing made up. It felt more realistic because of the premise of humans looking to space for survival. The climate change is real and given the incidents in 2021, it made the problem more imminent and the solution of escaping to other planets one of the most credible one. Elon musk rushing for Mars makes the escape theory altogether real.The way they capture and control that drone was ominous of something extraterrestrial and that line by Coop, ""This thing needs to adapt like us"" expresses his deep conviction of going to any length for human species survival.The space graphics were surreal and much better than what I see in documentaries. Wormholes are not very real but this movie made me want to believe their existence so badly. Travel though the wormhole would be an ultimate fantasy.Next one were the emotional and philosophical views as expressed in this one. The parent child relationships were beautifully portrayed in this one, be it of Coop and the his kids or Donald and Coop.Another one was the background score. Given that it is a Christopher Nolan movie, it is no brainer. It was amazing and too the point and fitting perfectly with the scenes and added to the magic of space.They say gravity is the best space movie ever made and still it's way below on the ratings chart as compared to this one. The reason being Interstellar has all the emotional aspects necessitating the space travel and its importance, making it more connecting as compared to of fixing a giant telescope.A must watch for all the space enthusiasts looking for a fulfilling 3 hours of a visual treat.8/10 for #Interstellar2014.",Interstellar
843,samuel-lewis12,It Was Like The Film Merged With Another Version From Parallel Earth,8/10,12 March 2018,"So I have to say that this film had awesome visual effects and a chilling musical score which did get a bit repetitive in some points of the film. The film also had a mostly good cast, however they were a few disposable characters who were not really needed and were just there to kill off, such as Matt Damon was pretty wasted. The concept of the film was good with a brilliant distopian future setting, however after the first 3 quarters of the film, WTF! what was going on, it was like the main guy was Jumping through parallel universes it was that complicated, i could barley understand the conclusion of the film as well. Did like the time dilatation stuff as that was rather cool. I would only recommend this film to people with high intelligence, i normally understand fairly complicated stories, but if the produces thought this film wasn't complicated, they must be having a laugh.

844,ppilf,"Interstellar is fantasy, not science fiction",5/10,26 February 2015,"Although the visual effects are good, Interstellar (shouldn't it be ""Intergalactic""?) is just too far-fetched. It's nothing like the believable film of human planetary migration that I was led to believe, and was hoping for. I've never been a fantasy fan. I majored in electrical-electronics engineering and physics in my 6 years of college, so I am a bit of a nerd and science stickler. When I view (or read) science fiction, to me the ""fiction"" should apply to the story, not to the science. In fantasy, the fiction applies to the science. Personally, I wish the film industry would make more realistic dramas about human space exploration. Hollywood's blockbuster profit machine abandons serious science fiction art, and, like Prometheus, made Interstellar into another action-packed CGI thriller crapper that caters to 13 to16 year-olds (the large demographic of movie going audience-$$$). And, of course, no sex, violence, horror, or language to get it an R rating.Interstellar's story is quite crazy. In it we humans, in the very distant future, discover how to communicate backward in time somehow by using gravity. Also, we (or they?) discover how to create crazy things like wormholes anywhere in time and space. Both of these things are quite insane. Anyway, our future humans supposedly use their fantastic smarts to send us (present humans) subtle messages that help in our quest to migrate to another planet, because earth is presently dying. And here's a real clincher, apparently our future selves have a morbid sense of humor, because they don't send us clear-cut messages (like any sensible race would do), they make it a silly game by sending mysterious coded riddles that we have to first solve. Things like coded binary numbers sent by arranging the books on the shelves in a young girl's bedroom; the numbers turn out to be coordinates to a giant secret underground NASA spaceship factory located below cornfields. Another mystery message leads us to a wormhole near the planet Saturn that our future super humans have kindly created for us, and maintained there. This fantastic (and quite absurd) wormhole leads to a cluster of candidate earth-like planets in a distant galaxy. But our future relatives don't want to make the game too easy, so the next step requires us to build numerous spacecraft, fly to and thru the wormhole, and explore the candidate planets to find which one is the jackpot. While doing this our explorers encounter all kinds of treacherous and crazy things, like planets with mile-high waves in 18-inch deep water, entering and exiting a rotating black hole, mentally unstable astronauts, and surviving and navigating fantastic spacecraft thru enormous gravitation fields that cause relativistic time dilation leaving an astronaut younger than his daughter. Typical things that any astronaut would experience over a few years right.I read that physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for this film, and he said he tried to keep it as authentic as possible. Well, he really stretched authentic here. I agree with ASU physicist Lawrence Krauss. I don't think Thorne served physics well working with this film. Oh I don't argue with his gravitational lensing, or other more straight forward aspects like the time dilation and the rotating black hole ""gargantua"". But things like our future ancestors communicating backward in time via gravity, and creating wormholes? Or like Cooper entering into a singularity, reversing time, fidgeting with the past (multiverses?), and then exiting? I'm not sure what world Thorne is living in to call all that authentic. For example, take the wormhole (..please!). This hypothetical concept is a physics metaphor used in teaching general relativity. Many people may not know that there is absolutely no evidence or accepted scientific theory suggesting that wormholes actually exist in any form anywhere, or, even more fantastic, can be created and traversed by humans. In fact the inconceivable energy, matter, and forces alone involved with such a hypothetical warp would make it impossible for humans to ""create"" one. Black holes, on the other hand, are not only scientifically known to be possible, but are known to exist. Entering and exiting the event horizon of a rotating black hole is purely hypothetical, and is certainly not considered scientifically possible, partly because literally nothing is known about black hole singularity. Yet all these things are depicted in very silly fantasy in Interstellar. Also, I swore I saw a 2013 Dodge Ram pickup and a cute robot with artificial human intelligence in the movie. Fantasy. It appeals to the target child audience.Not only the wacky science, but the excessive pace of Interstellar made for a poor film. There's no pausing to smell roses in this film. The fast pace hindered character development and made for shallow story development. Frankly, I can't remember being so happy to see a movie end. It became a struggle to watch. Also, a lot of McConaughey's speech seemed to be at whisper level bordering on mumble, which I found irritating. The background music was okay, but not great.I consider the films Gravity, and my favorite, Alien (1979), much better. They aren't perfect realism, but at least they don't have ghosts from the future and manmade wormholes.In closing, I must say that I truly do believe humanity will someday migrate from earth, but it will NEVER be anything like this movie depicts. How sure am I of this? If I'm wrong I hereby promise to pay each living human being in the universe a million dollars. Being able to afford that is more probable than the science in this film.",Interstellar
845,DylanAnglin,Interstellar Review,9/10,6 November 2018,"So far Nolan has not disappointed. Interstellar is a mind twister. From its beautiful visuals, to its great and superb acting Interstellar is a much watch. The world is coming to an end and Matthew McConaughey (who is easily the best actor in this movie) must try and find humanity a new place to live. Without getting into spoilers definitely check this film out. You will not be disappointed. 9/10

848,marksez,This Movie Steals from Everywhere,10/10,4 January 2015,"So many movies are just a rehash of other movies. The many plots are dropped into a Hollywood blender and the writers make a movie of out whatever comes out. That said, for this movie, the writers did a great job. Sure Albert Einstein, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C.Clark and other great scientists and science fiction writers are rolling their eyes in disgust and amazement at a movie that plays fast and loose with science and physics. Still, if you're willing to put all expectations of believability aside, this is really good entertainment.The movie has some of the best actors, good acting, good writing and really nice special effects.

849,Lambysalamby,Everything great Sci Fi should be... A Masterpiece.,10/10,11 May 2015,"I saw a film tonight, and what a film. Sci Fi would be my absolute favourite genre, and this is easily the best of that genre, as well as being one of the best films I have ever seen. I was literally speechless when the credits rolled. (I selected some great films to watch this week) The dialogue and the science of the film are fantastic, and I was captivated from the beginning. The cast were all excellent with Matthew McConaughey adding yet another brilliant performance to his ever growing list.. Perhaps the best performance of all was that of Hans Zimmer, maybe one of the composers best soundtracks yet. (from his ever growing list) The music really draws you into this movie and in moments nearly brings tears to your eyes...The effects of the movie were mind blowing, and real models were used for the spacecraft's giving it more authenticity and depth.The film is very much influenced by 2001 A Space Odyssey and as such, has generated a bit of hatred for the film, with people saying it goes too spiritual, but I do not fathom that for a second, rather I think many people just couldn't take it all in and understand it... Overall: Its AMAZING. Jump at it!Comparatively, other movies I rated the full 10; Akira, Open your eyes, Malèna, Whiplash, The Fall, The SKin I live in....",Interstellar
850,gogga1011,How stupid they think we are?,6/10,6 April 2015,"Thanks to good critics and media hype I've decided to get rid off of 3 hours of my life. Sadly, most of the movie I was bored. Story is so shallow and predictable - in very beginning I concluded that her's father is writing those messages (every average sci-fi reader knows some theories of black-hole), and movie has some serious intellectual and emotional issues.First of all, Matthew McC. is solid actor, but he isn't charismatic as Al Pacino or even Tom Cruise. He is always the same. Same face, same grimaces, same tone. And now... he is flying in a spaceship through the whole space and boarding space station without problems after 10 or 15 years of inactivity... are you serious?? How stupid you think we are? And cryogenic sleep - they are immediately ready to go after it and jumping around like jolly rabbits?All characters aren't written well. They are very plane and somewhat emotionally distracted. At the end - Matthew is coming after the greatest achievement in human history, I repeat: greatest achievement in human history - but nobody even look at him..??? HALLOOOOOO???All in all, it would be a lot better movie if they cut bullshits, and give us more ""space-feeling"" (something like those in Space Odyssey or Gravity), sound and vision, and turn actors in real human beings.Purposely, I didn't talk about some scientific imperfections, because we don't know much about anything. Even serious scientists changing their mind every few weeks, from ordinary things to black hole, they aren't sure in almost anything. Maybe it is stupid premise that man from the future is sending coordinates to go in space, although he at first said himself not to go? But hey, this is just a movie. So, I will not bother you with things that may or may not be scientific true and are in writers domain. But sadly, I must recognize that even after FORTYSIX YEARS Hollywood isn't capable of producing so massive, magnificent and intellectually thrilling space-movie as Kubrick's Space Odyssey was!Yeah, good old Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke... made it in 1969, and that masterpiece is still immense!Shame on you, greedy Hollywood bastards.Thumb down.",Interstellar

854,mymtproject,I finally saw this movie. It's lengthy but worth the time.,9/10,3 November 2016,"Take your time watching this and pay attention to some of the minor details, they turn out to be major to the plot later on.A future Earth has exhausted the quality of planet's soil because humanity became too numerous (more than 6 billion) and a former pilot, would-be astronaut named Cooper is directed to an old NORAD site where NASA has been sending probes and manned ships into a wormhole that opened next to the planet Saturn. He finds the facility with the help of his daughter, who has been making notes about gravitational anomalies in their home (books falling off a shelf in specific numbered places) and figures out they are given coordinates. These coordinates lead them to the NORAD site. Fast forward, he joins the next NASA mission which send himself and three other scientist through the wormhole to investigate a new solar system with many worlds that humankind might be able to inhabit, since Earth is dying. With their fuel, they can only explore three but these are three worlds where previous, one-way missions ventured to see if they were habitable. They come up short on the first world which has huge gravitational fluctuations because it's close to a giant black hole. They are then lured to the second world by an unscrupulous scientist who was part of one of the earlier manned mission to explore the new planets. He wants to leave and tries to hijack the main ship in orbit around his captive world, only to kill himself and damage the main ship. Using one of Einstein's theories concerning black holes, he is able to slingshot the damage ship towards the last world they can explore, sending one remaining scientist and a robot assistant on board to reach the third planet. Coop releases himself in another spacecraft from the main ship and flies into the event horizon of the black hole. There he finds himself in a strange room that seems made of lines but is really a fifth dimension where he can look through and see his young daughter on the other side of the bookshelf where books where falling. He recognizes that she is the same age and it's the same time as when she first told him about the books. He also realizes that it was HIM sending her messages all along. Beyond this point, I won't give anything else away and my hands are getting tired too. LOL! It's a very complex movie but rewarding for those who want to invest the time (runtime is 169 minutes) to watch. It delivers on a lot of logical, theoretical and emotional levels. It makes you ask the question, can those of the future help those of the past. There is a lot of paradox in this story, so be prepared for that and free up your mind, otherwise it will cook your noggin!A solid 8 out of 10. It definitely pays homage to 2001, A SPACE ODESSY, at least in my opinion.",Interstellar

860,klausming,Incredibly ambitious and intensely engaging,8/10,16 March 2015,"Interstellar is a visually stunning and superbly scored science fiction epic about the last days on earth and the astronauts who travel to a distant galaxy to find a home for what is left of humanity. With a challenging story that is monumental in scale, it is the personal motivations of the ship's pilot and his heartrending relationship with his daughter that provides the emotional glue which holds the film together. Their relationship is also the main plot device that carries humanity's fate and which is the basis of the film's emotional power. A beautiful blend of fiction, science and drama, Interstellar is an incredibly ambitious and intensely engaging film that is destined to be a future classic of the science fiction genre (Klaus Ming March 2015).",Interstellar

863,paris_whitney_hilton_nyc,"Interstinker , A Space Odyssey",1/10,8 November 2014,"This dreary , boring , depressing , and overly long sci-fi flick is about the dying Earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings . Unless you are Stephen Hawking or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or you possess a degree in quantum physics , thermodynamics , time warps , black holes and worm holes, you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with . To make matters worse, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best mumbler in Hollywood . I did not understand a single line that came out of his face !... Anyway, The Great Dust Bowl of the 1930's has returned to wreck havoc on the world, only this time it really means business . Matthew McConaughey , the world's greatest astronaut turned farmer , is chosen to be the Earth's savior . His interstellar space craft Endurance ,is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time . It is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions , collisions , and a gigantic tsunami wave 1,000 feet high . Anne Hathaway is the cryogenics expert . She looks a lot more convincing playing Catwoman than the Endurance's genius co astronaut . This movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an IQ of under 140 to comprehend . Interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours . I would recommend George Pal's 1951 sci-fi classic "" When Worlds Collide "" over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk . ... Not hot, PWH",Interstellar
864,rossini-1868,It ain't Kubrik...,7/10,2 April 2015,"If Interstellar had not been directed by one of the movie gods, what would its reception have been? Its been a while since I've seen a more glaring example of a vanity project, where the director was able to literally relax and phone it in through most of the movie. The acting is an exercise in minimalism, which is fine if you're in The Shining or A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey. I was about to dismiss this as a tragic wanna be mess of existentialist nonsenseuntil I saw the ending.Aside from Hathaway's face, and McConaughey's increasingly compelling overall presence as an actor, the movie does raise some interesting philosophical questions. Are we better off just coming together here, dying together here? Or scuffling around pointlessly among the stars, trying to start all over somewhere else? Building something that won't be any better than what we have here, because of what lies in the hearts of men? Everywhere we go, we carry with us the tragedy of human existence: our fallen nature, the evil that lives inside the human heart.By the end of the movie, I had to conclude that in his own hyperintellectual, roundabout way, Nolan has managed to relay the same disturbing, tragic message that all good fiction seems to do. That ultimately, mankind's time on earth is finite and doomed, and the only things that will save us are our reliance on a higher power for guidance, and the love that we have for each other. This ain't Kubrik, or even Zemeckis for that matter. But at least, it is Christopher Nolan.",Interstellar

Its a stretch but some parts are still enjoyable.

More could have been explained with what happened to the ecosystem ... what about the the change of mental state through epochs ?. That alone could be a interesting movie ...
hawkings talks about ideas that should be in movies but haven't been implemented. ... Yet!.Like inception this movie deludes the audience with tantalizing concepts not fully conceptualized...
but could be a spring board for future film makers ...
sometimes i am let down by movies that promise too much . Some 13 year old is gonna think they have just had a quantum physics lecture ... ( sorry if i sound too harsh.) ...its less context and more deconstructed simulacra ...

869,kadenkgcampbell,Unbelievably Beautiful and Unique,10/10,4 August 2021,"Christopher Nolan honestly deserves multiple Oscars for the amazing movies he has created. Inception, the Dark Knight Trilogy, Tenet, and Interstellar. I cannot believe have magnificent this movie is. I don't even have children but the relationship between Murph and Cooper was extraordinary and relatable. Matthew's acting was top notch. The movies unique and creative story and storytelling was something I have never seen to this day in 2021. This is one of my favourite movies and I have just rewatched it for the fourth time. Space exploration is so incredible and mind boggling, Christopher Nolan did a phenomenal job portraying his interpretation of it. I believe someday, this could be true. This movie deserved more recognition and its a shame some people do not notice it. 10/10.

872,sd-forum,Good but not great,8/10,5 November 2014,"I would say that this is a good movie but not great. I love these kinds of movies. I loved Contact (Robert Zemeckis), felt transported. Again felt transported by Sunshine (Danny Boyle), but did not feel transported by this movie. I was aware at all time I'm watching a movie. I'm not sure exactly why but probably part to some bad acting, bad storytelling and some very bad choices.*** Spoilers *** ahead. Stop reading.Casting Matt Damon was probably too much. I also didn't like the robot. It didn't feel realistic at all. Nolan trying to have something different went too far. No way I can accept that a big ridiculous wall is a reasonable shape for an intelligent walking robot. It screams look how clever we are.Also it was a bad idea to cast Ellen Burstyn as old Murph. That's the most important emotional moment of the movie and immediately you feel it's someone else, it's not Murph. I think even if they had used Jessica Chastain in a bad old makeup, it would have been better.",Interstellar
873,cloud_nine,Good But Confusing,7/10,6 November 2014,"Overall I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" but left the theater with major plot holes running through my head. Matthew McConaughey mumbled a bit so I lost a lot of his dialog. The soundtrack made great use of pipe organ music which reminded me of ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" from ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" This may have been deliberate. Another feature from ""2001"" was the confusing, metaphysical ending. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADCooper passes out in some sort of 5th dimension and wakes up in a hospital bed. His daughter, who is now elderly and near death, is responsible for saving humanity. The human race lives in a space wheel (like in ""Elysium"") orbiting Saturn. Why not orbiting Earth? And HOW was Cooper's daughter responsible for this? Did these trips through the wormhole really accomplish anything?Maybe other people in the audience caught something I missed or couldn't wrap my brain around. A group of people were discussing the movie in the lobby when I left.In closing, ""Interstellar"" is worth your time and money. There really weren't any times when the movie lagged. It starts out at a moderate pace and doesn't let up. Be prepared to pay attention and think.",Interstellar
874,pacocharte,8.6? Are you kidding me?,1/10,4 July 2021,"Has to be the 'Nolan Factor' or something that this film has a higher overall rating than masterpieces like ""Chinatown"", ""The Shining"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" to name just a few. This is absolutely not a better film than any of those and it's way too long and completely unbelievable to boot.Nolan does a decent job getting the audience to suspend their disbelief (as he always does), even going so far as to hire experts in astrophysics and astronomy. Certainly some of the plot devices are theoretically plausible, but as a person with an education in physics (up to two semesters of quantum mechanics) and a strong interest in science fiction, this part of the movie just didn't add up.Again, the film is VERY long, and Christopher Nolan has MANY fans (of which I am one), but let's get real here. ""Interstellar"" takes on a lot and does a decent job of tying it all together, but this isn't enduring classic cinema on any level and the writing could have been better.

877,sreethered,INTERSTELLAR: Different Perspectives...,8/10,10 November 2014,"Scenario 1: As a serious movie buff:- Someone who scrutinizes a movie with keen observation might found Nolan's new epic space drama lacks a few things. Like,1)A strong script: Interstellar, apart from it's stellar visuals is a hollow one. There isn't anything new that we would expect from the director. 2)Simply isn't Nolan's best work: Nolan had done a lot of home work for this one, which is evident in the production. But, what makes Nolan movies perfect is the twisting, unpredictable storyline. Interstellar is a predictable plot for someone who has common sense 3)Camera works and lighting are not that brilliant: Interstellar, which doesn't have the technical brilliance of last year's Gravity, is not that innovative in the camera department. We were expecting more from a director who made Memento. With all that one may find Interstellar an average flick, if he dared to go deep into the details.Scenario 2:As a science buff:- For someone, who read about black holes and imagined what will it be to travel through one, this movie is priceless. As Nolan's most ambitious work, he spent a lot of time time to make the science right, which made him sacrifice a lot of other elements. Making a movie out of a science book was a great leap in terms of Sci-Fi movies and even though it may not surpass Space Odyssey, it can rest on it's side. Scenario 3: A regular movie goer:- For regular audience, who may look for some eye candy, some good acting and some sentiments, Interstellar is a perfect choice for the weekend.It's brilliant visualization of the unknown, brilliant performances from McConaughey, Chastain, Hathaway and probably everyone on board, marks Interstellar a stellar one. Matt Damon's surprising turn as Mann was also brilliant. As per the scenarios, Interstellar can be labelled as a wonderful cinematic experience other than a brilliant use of arts and artists.....",Interstellar
878,austinfromdahood,Interstellar: Amazing even with its major flaws,8/10,4 August 2018,"After a while, Christopher Nolan decided that he wanted to make a space film, maybe something as big as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Everyone was hoping that Interstellar was going to be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but it's not. Interstellar is not a perfect film. It has a good amount of flaws, but it is still an amazing film. Let's start with the amazing performances. Matthew Mcconaughey has one of his best performances in this movie, and the emotion he expressed in this film actually made me cry at times. The actors that play the character Murph (the actors played younger and older versions of this character) had riveting performances and she also made me cry at the emotional moments. The cgi in this film gives me chills thinking about it because all the space and planet sequences looked so real and beautiful, it's probably one of the best cgi used in any film EVER! The story is about finding a new habitable planet, but the real theme of this movie is love. Matthew Mcconaughey's character had the choice of either finding a new planet and leaving his life behind, or staying with his family and letting the earth turning inhabitable. He chose to find a new habitable planet, and he and his daughter being apart, and him eventually regretting his actions has such a great emotional impact. The emotional impact in this film is probably the best aspect of this film, and this is one of the best emotionally driven Christopher Nolan films. But sadly, there is a handful of flaws. Matthew Mcconaughey was accompanied by other astronauts on this mission, and I did not really care about them or their backstories at all. Anne Hathaway plays one of the accompanying astronauts, and the movie concentrates more than they should on her, and I wasn't invested in her subplot because I cared way more for Matthew Mcconaughey and his daughter. Matt Damon also played an astronaut that was stranded on a planet with malicious intentions, and I even though his appearance is out of nowhere, I really did not care about him at all and I feel like he didn't even need to be in this film. The pacing of the first half is also very slow and at times did drag, but the second half really did escalate and became more of what this movie was supposed to be. I like the second half way better than the first half. Even with its glaring flaws, I still think this is a great film. 4/5P.S: The score is also outstanding, one of Han Zimmer's best",Interstellar
879,Westcoastal,Shallow and Hugely Disappointing,6/10,4 April 2015,"I love sci fi, and I'm a pretty easy target because I am really able to get into a story without ripping it to shreds every step of the way. I should LOVE this movie, but I found it profoundly disappointing. For one thing, the story was SO overly melodramatic that at times I was wondering if they were being sarcastic. I am a sucker for emotional depth, but this story was incredibly shallow and superficial. The tech was interesting, but again, really not very believable on so many levels. The plot was so full of holes that I stopped bothering after awhile. In terms of performances, nothing to get excited about. Really, the actors did their best with an embarrassingly poor script.I'm going to give these guys the benefit of the doubt and assume that a huge chunk of what this film was about ended up on the cutting room floor. There was a lot of potential that was squandered here, and I hate to think this is the movie they intended to make.

881,Imaculata,"Better than 2001, and that's saying a lot",9/10,5 July 2015,"A sci-fi master piece.Well... goes to show that you really never can trust any of the critics. This movie is a master piece. I would easily put it up there with the likes of 2001 a space odyssey. Why did I listen to the reviews, and not go see this in the theater? This movie blew me away. I was not expecting much, but I got so much more. The science is solid, great acting, great direction, and a great plot. If you've been to recent Hollywood blockbusters like Jurassic World, you'd almost think competent screen writing is dead. I mean come on! Weaponized raptors? But this movie is a breath of fresh air. I already liked director Christopher Nolan for his Dark Knight trilogy, and The Prestige. But I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did.It takes its time to build up the story, and the characters. The plot got me hooked almost immediately. But where the movie really shines is the science. When I watch a sci-fi movie, I want to be wowed by gadgets that seem credible and original. I want to see future technology, and not nonsense. I want to see the characters make competent decisions, and not act completely irrational just for the convenience of the plot. And boy, this movie surprised me with how well written the characters are, and how logical they act. The plot did not take any cheap short cuts. it cleverly avoided the typical Hollywood plot writing, by having the characters make the right decisions, while still coming up with obstacles that are credible. On top of that, during the last part of the movie it drops a huge twist on the audience, that I honestly did not see coming. I won't spoil it here.What I also like, is how the movie takes its time to show the aftermath of all the events. It doesn't just end, but goes on for a bit longer to show us most of the things that we want to see. There were a few moments where it seemed the movie fast forwarded a bit too fast, which was confusing at times. So the movie does demand your full attention. I suspect that maybe some scenes were cut out to reduce the running time, and may have affected the pacing of some events. I would be very curious to see an extended cut, if it exists.Regarding the aftermath and the ending, I think this is where I actually like this movie better than 2001 a space odyssey. I know that is controversial, and many people would probably yell out ""heresy"" at the mere thought of liking this over Kubrick's classic. To give a quick recap of my thoughts on this famous Kubrick movie, I think it's too much style over substance. The pacing is too slow and artsy-fartsy, making the movie a chore to sit through. It has its moments for sure, and the cinematography is a work of art. However, the ending while memorable, is also very vague and open to interpretation. One might even call it a bit unsatisfying or lazy. A cop out. So perhaps this provides some context to why I like the ending of Interstellar better; it answers all of your questions. I felt the sequel to 2001, called 2010, was also much better movie as well in many ways. While it didn't have the amazing cinematography of Kubrick, it was better paced, and did answer all the questions of the previous movie and of its own. Plus it was just much more enjoyable to sit through, even on repeated viewings. I cannot say the same for 2001.So why the comparisons with 2001? Well the two movies have a lot in common, especially near the end. If you see the movie, you'll see what I mean.But I think I like Interstellar better. Yes, I know. Scowl at me if you want. But I think Kubrick is not the holy grail of film making, and this is a better sci-fi movie that pretty much follows very similar themes. Perhaps Interstellar would have never existed if it weren't for movies like 2001, and that is a fair argument. But I think ultimately that Interstellar is just way more satisfying. It is not afraid to bring the plot full circle, and answer all of the questions.",Interstellar
882,victuki,The Ultimate Journey,9/10,7 November 2014,"I won't be objective about this. I think Nolan saved modern filmmaking from mediocrity. He has shown that being epic is an option, whether you succeed or not (there is a blunder around him). It is a way of expression, and at the end of the day it is all about quality, plain and simple.Interstellar is an example, a story with such a scope it literally transcends space and time. Mankind is in a delicate situation. Environment issues and gravitational anomalies threat the very existence of the human race. The only salvation might be a bold mission through a wormhole near Saturn, and investigate what is beyond. The ultimate journey, an interstellar one...As usual, Nolan works with top-notch pros, a highly awarded cast, including McConaughey, Caine, Hathaway and some surprising cameos. Wally Pfister, the usual D.O.P. of Nolan, was busy with his debut ""Trascendence"" (2014), but Hans Zimmer repeats as the score master. And he makes it again, a glorious score, though it tends to copy the music from ""2001: A Space Odissey"" (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). It is not a perfect score as the one he wrote for ""Inception"" (2010), but it works.As for the movie itself, there is just one thing I did not like. An entire section of the film could be cut out and would not really affect the rest of the story, and we are talking about forty minutes, but then again, it is an opinion and I am sure some fanatics will try to come after me carrying torches. Other than that, this is a story in which we find drama, thrill and stunning visuals (the design of the robots is amazing, they become characters, just like the rest of the cast). Science-fiction is based on actual scientific theories, from black holes, relativity etc. (even Dr. De Grasse Tyson would approve it). So Nolan is behind another ""tour de force"" of excess, proof that to him, it is all or nothing.Nolan has been compared to Kubrick as they both shared a taste for breathtaking visuals, and also a passion for his projects, though with different approaches (Kubrick was far more unsociable). It is not for me to decide if that is true, but I know that with this film, Nolan proves himself to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Once again, as it happened with ""Inception""(2010), just trying to undertake such a task is enough to get an Oscar award. No matter if you have the tools and the resources, this is about having a vision and going for it. Another masterpiece of modern filmmaking.",Interstellar
883,PStyles,A Film Which Will Transcend Generations,10/10,3 March 2018,"So many people have already reviewed this film, but after my most recent viewing, I now feel compelled to write a review as well. Films like ""Interstellar"" come along very rarely; but when they do, they transcend generations. This film, deep down, is about love and how it can penetrate barriers we didn't even know existed. While the science behind this film may not be completely accurate, the concept is spot on; Nolan's writing compels us to see the value in the most confusing and powerful of all emotions which human beings share. I simply cannot applaud him enough for bringing us a story which teaches a real lesson about the human condition. He also brings us a story that can be enjoyed on many different levels; if you aren't one for the sentimental stuff, then take solace in the fact that there is plenty of thrilling moments within this film. If you want an intense sci-fi experience, then this will certainly deliver; however, it is my feeling that this story is about much more than the end of the world and space travel. Thus, those who seek a deeper meaning will be rewarded as well. The acting in this film is nothing short of sensational; Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, simply put. This movie, along with ""Dallas Buyers Club"", have significantly changed my opinion of him as an actor. His recent body of work clearly shows that he is more than just an attractive rom-com star. Anne Hathaway also delivers a great performance, and showed range that I did not know she had. Perhaps the best of them all, though, is Mackenzie Foy as 10-year old Murph. Her performance was so genuine that it moved me emotionally, which is something that doesn't often happen for me in movies. There are many other noteworthy performances as well; I could go on and on. This film has some of the best supporting actors in the business (Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, ect...). Lastly, i'll touch on the plot. While it can be boiled down to a few simple constructs, overtly it is quite complex. It may take a few viewings to truly digest everything that happens in this film, but I think this is one of the things that makes it so great. Not unlike Nolan's other masterpiece, ""Inception"", one can take away different things from each new play through of ""Interstellar"". This, along with the themes of survival, love, humanity, and faith are ultimately why I think this movie will go down as one of the greatest of all time (and transcend generations to come).Ultimately, this film isn't perfect; it very close, however, and the flaws that it has can easily be overlooked by everything it does well. While the sentimental undertones or the extreme science fiction backdrop may be a bit too much for some (those familiar with quantum mechanics may find it a bit too unrealistic), I think most who view this will find it remarkable. Christopher Nolan continues to revolutionize cinema with his bold stories and ideas, and ""Interstellar"" is yet another notch on his belt. Don't miss this one folks, as it will most certainly be a film that resonates with generations to come.",Interstellar
884,ssunny-social,"Ambitious but still no ""2001""",8/10,11 November 2014,"Nolan is always somebody to watch out for ever since his popularity soared with ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. The box office success of a complex movie like Inception was proof enough. ""Interstellar"" was the most awaited film of the year for the thinking movie buffs director and he clearly has delivered the expectations to a very large extent. The movie starts very slow trying to build upon the characters and allowing the audiences to develop a bond with their relations. It explains the need of traveling to the outer space and following the bread crumbs left to them by people they don't know since the world is in a state of extinction for humans after the agriculture gets affected by Dwight. This first half is dedicated a lot to the relationship that the protagonist (Cooper), shares with his family, especially his daughter, who herself plays an important role in the film. The film might look a bit stretched here for its multiple scenes that could have been harmlessly edited but may be Nolan was only trying to save us from complaining the monotony the silence of space and the limited number of characters would later give once they take off their adventure.It abruptly evolves as a space adventure in the second half where the astronauts are trying to search for the right planet to settle in. But as the movie progresses this potentially fantastic drama is bogged down by turgid discussions of abstruse physics which in a lot of places might be too far to grasp (Romiliy's explanation of his own version of Plan A). The movie still remains largely understandable since those details don't matter much as the plot mostly depends on the outline which even if given casual viewing won't be a work to absorb. The movie is a unique space drama and stands on its own, though it has multiple traces of Solaris and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It tries to be a lot of things and in the process becomes helplessly pretentious sometimes. But the grand scale and lofty ambitions should not go without saluting the man behind it, Nolan. Like all his other movies he doesn't keep even this completely honest but adds a bit of commercialism here and there with quotes being spoken at the back drop, conventional delivery of one liners and many co-incidences beyond imagination. The visuals with the blue screen being used as minimal as possible gives it a very real feel and the music is consistently beautiful and quite different from what Hans Zimmer did with few of his last films. When it comes to cinematography I would have still wanted Pfister to do this one as well. But the Nolan regular was limited by time constraints. This is a potential blockbuster as long as people don't mind its length and gaping loopholes, though I still wouldn't call this a game changer ""2001"", ""Blade Runner"" or ""Matrix"" was.",Interstellar
885,Jwdjrs,Best Movie of 2014,9/10,3 January 2015,"Interstellar is about a man and a group of people from NASA that go into space to find a new place for the people of Earth to live because Earth is dying. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, and Casey Affleck. The score is composed by Hans Zimmer. Interstellar is directed by Christopher Nolan.Now, first off, I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. He is my favorite director of all time. This was my most anticipated film of the year. Some of my favorite movies ever are The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and now Interstellar. I'm also a big fan of Hans Zimmer (the composer).So how was the movie: absolutely fantastic! The acting, the directing, the visuals, the score, the plot, and the script are all amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances. Anne Hathaway has never been better. Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely brilliant. Christopher Nolan has created one of his best movies to date.I only have but one minor problem with the movie: it takes a while to get things moving. And I will say that I didn't understand everything about the movie after I first saw it. The more that I see the movie, the more that I understand it. If you're a Nolan fan, like me, or if you're just a fan of good movies, then this movie is definitely worth checking out. I hope that it at least gets nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year at the Oscars. Don't let me down, Academy.",Interstellar
886,indiana1981,Brilliant Watch,10/10,1 April 2018,"I finally got round to watching this movie, 4 years after to came out and it definitely lived up to the hype! It's essentially a love story between a father and his children; and the guilt he carries with him whilst going on a mission across space and time, to help save a dying planet Earth. But with space's time relatively being warped, (after he's travelled through a black), every hour spent in this new galaxy, is equal to 7 years back on earth. And it fears he'll never make it back before his kids die, or even back at all. There are lots of sub-plots to this film too, which I won't ruin. But to make it clear, this isn't a typical ""lost in space movie"". It's moving and sad at times! Which makes it a bloody good and unique sci-fi movie!The acting is also superb in the film, particular by Matthew McConnagy, Jessica Chastain and the young actress who plays Jessica, as a young kid.Brilliant sci-fi movie and the best I've see in years.",Interstellar
887,disizzgsk,Christopher Another thought of Seed become Universe That is Interstellar,10/10,30 July 2017,"Christopher Nolan, I became fan of time after watch Dark Knight then go back to all his movies. When i saw Inception decided my one and only favourite director. Interstellar OMG can't expect about his inside thoughts, Even NASA praised this movie. Interstellar is a vision to NASA, A vision and Imaginary concept Christopher showed on the screen. Nobody wouldn't explain with understanding in scientific style.Explain about Black holes, Gravity,space ship travels and that space ship becomes time machine also, time spend on different planets- Christopher wow what a ideas. I do not understand few concepts till yet. Must watch movie number of times. 10 rating is also less value for this movie.

888,Reviewer746,Nolan's Masterpiece,7/10,4 August 2015,"This is by far the most entertaining movie I have seen given the number of plot holes and inaccuracies (which I will get to shortly). I concur with everyone who has seen it in saying that Interstellar is a visually stunning movie. If you didn't have a chance to see it in IMAX you really did miss out.The soundtrack is very overpraised in my opinion. Yes, it has the organ... if this is your principal praise then unfortunately you don't know much about what makes a good soundtrack. The audio could definitely be better but I thought the decibel level was appropriate (some viewers reported faulty audio in theaters but I did not have this experience).As for inaccuracies and plot holes... Does anyone find it a bit odd that the transdimensional beings/future humans would decide to help humanity, and by extension themselves, survive by placing a wormhole in orbit around Saturn (necessitating the most ambitious spaceflight in human history) leading to a black hole system in another galaxy with a dozen potentially habitable planets requiring the astronauts to explore each one in turn? How about... I don't know... fixing the blight on Earth instead.If NASA sent space probes to orbit the planets beforehand, wouldn't they already have a good idea of which planets were habitable? Wouldn't they at least know not to land on the water planet with the unrealistically large tidal waves since a glance at the surface shows it's entirely covered in water? Why did the astronauts conclude that because the place they landed in had 1 foot of water that the entire planet was covered in water? Why not just look out the window of the space ship and conclude ""yep, definitely covered in water"". How is TARS supposed to ""transmit"" the ""quantum data"" out of the black hole? Why did humanity cease producing MRIs because of crop shortages? Why did the US military design their combat robots after Minecraft characters?Perhaps the most frustrating plot hole is the ""bootstrap paradox"" inherent to the plot. It is based on a non-linear theory of time that doesn't have much support in the physics community and is especially hard to accept when its justification in the movie is love.And yet somehow... despite all of the above plot holes, inaccuracies, and other general grievances, Interstellar still manages to be the best movie of 2014 by a huge margin. This movie easily earns the 9 stars. It is so entertaining that, even though you catch all the inaccuracies while you're watching it, you just don't care. Future generations of space faring humans will look back and see movies like this as a part of our contemporary cultural yearn for exploring beyond the Earth's gravity well. And for that, I am grateful to Christopher Nolan.",Interstellar
889,eichler2,"Way, way overrated",1/10,25 November 2015,"OK, first off, the movie clearly doesn't deserve 1 star - I just gave it that to try to counterbalance all the undeserved 10 star reviews that currently give it an vastly over-inflated 8.7 average.I'll try to keep this brief by just listing the good and the bad: Good:1. Some impressive visuals 2. Some interesting ideas. Kind of.Bad: 1. Bad storytelling - half the time it was near-impossible to figure out what was going on, or why the characters were doing what they were doing.2. Way too long. Seriously, this movie was easily an hour longer than it needed to be. At least.3. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Not incorrect scientific facts so much as things just being unrealistic. For example - if the future humans (or whoever set up the whole black hole library thing) had the capability to do that, why couldn't they just send us a clear message from the future to help us out? Why this convoluted plan to get Cooper into the black hole to send ridiculous messages back to himself and his daughter using Morse code, binary code, etc? 4. Way too obvious - why couldn't the characters figure out that the data Matt Damon was sending was fake? One look at the planet made it pretty clear it was uninhabitable, and I saw the whole ""he was so lonely he'd do anything to get rescued"" plot line coming up. But none of our super-smart heroes could figure that out? I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the rave reviews it got, but in the end I thought it was somewhere between awful and just barely passable. And through the last hour of the movie I kept checking my watch and wondering how much longer until it was over.If you can see it cheap, it's probably worth watching, just keep your expectations really low.",Interstellar
890,alconway,My favourite film of all time,10/10,12 August 2018,"I saw this at the cinema when it first came out and I've watched it several times since, including today. I will watch it many more times in my life.
I'm a man in my 40s now, was late 30s at the time I first saw it.
When I left the cinema the first time, I was in tears, I walked home and was still in tears about 30 mins later at home, blubbing to my wife, who couldn't understand what had happened to me because I couldn't even speak properly.
That's how strongly the movie affected me. I am in tears now, having watched it again.I love space movies, post apocalyptic movies, Christopher Nolan movies, so I was probably going to enjoy it but I can assure you I have never come out of the cinema with even a twitch in my eye after any other such movies.
Feeling tearful if googled ""interstellar makes"" and it filled in ""...me cry"" so I'm not the only one.
I see some people didn't enjoy it (1/10 seems a bit extreme but each to their own), I wonder if it meant more to me because I am a father of a girl? It would be good to hear from others who felt strongly either way but we can't discuss on IMDb anymore since the forums were taken down.
I recommend this movie to anyone and hope you enjoy it, remember to take a hanky.",Interstellar
891,samgreer-694-680740,Worth seeing for sci-fi fans,7/10,10 November 2014,"I consider myself a sci-fi fan. This film had pleasant and unpleasant surprises. For one, the fairly-well established backstory seems to indicate this film is set some time in the future. The set, however, is remarkably devoid of any futuristic devices and improvements at all. A farmhouse from 1975. A Dodge Ram from 2000, and a NASA spaceship from way in the future?? Everything on the set is from present day, every car, building, laptop, and with the amount of books in Murph's bedroom the set almost seems to be from the past. I mean what kid has any books today, much less in the future? This kid has a library in her room. That disparity was a bit of a disappointment. Pleasant surprises included the cast for me as I had no idea Michael Caine or Matt Damon were even in the cast. This is EASILY McConaughey's best work and the only other work he's done I enjoyed as much as this was A Time to Kill. There is a scene with Matt Damon that absolutely scared the poop out of me and everyone in the theater. Fantastic production with no expense spared. And other than the ""threat to the planet"" theme and absolutely, shamelessly STEALING a scene directly out of Event Horizon, this film scores good originality points (although I think I've seen a Twilight Zone with a similar theme) Last unpleasant surprises include Anne Hathaway and her acting. She has the acting depth of Daphne from Scooby-Doo and I dread seeing her cast in anything. Overall there is just too much overall in this movie. Its like Indiana Jones meets Star Trek as the protagonist overcomes insurmountable challenges too often and too frequently. The soundtrack is loud enough to wake the dead and that always seems to be a crutch to give impact to weak scenes. It's not needed, the scenes are not weak. They are intense, often too frequently, and the loud sound is unnecessary and undesirable. The resolution is original, but VERY unbelievable unless you're 9 years old. It REALLY puts the FICTION in science fiction, which was disappointing since the gravity of the problems on Earth and the moral and ethical questions pondered in the film would be lost on a 9 year old - so why the Saturday morning cartoon ending? If you're going to make a film for adults, please make the entire film, including the resolution for adults. I can handle it I promise. Lastly, there is a bit of the ADD scene hopping I first noticed in Oculus. Just stop. Stop doing that forever. The flashing back and forth between a farm and another galaxy with the speed of a music video only insults me as you clumsily attempt to beat me (your viewer) over the head with your sledgehammer of juxtaposition. Please stop making films for morons. If they can't figure it out, they'll never miss it, but its getting borderline offensive for normal IQ patrons. For all these reasons I gave this movie a 7. MY GF is not a sci-fi fan and did not like it. I better qualify that as a 7 for sci-fi fans only!",Interstellar

Have to give it a 10 because of the lack of good movies nowadays, whereof most are totally overrated here. I haven't seen a good movie in 10 years now that speaks to me. Last movie i felt something for was Alexander the Great from 2004.There is an interesting realism in this movie. The actors do a really really superb job interpreting their characters and thus the movie has it all, great scenery, good acting, nice story and it is unpredictable, which today is quite hard to find. Sure there is CGI but it is subtle and executed with quality. Also i as a father really enjoy the emotional aspects of this movie; the overarching love for ones children.

Of course that's not bad or wrong -- each person has their own interests.First off, this flick is too long at almost 3 hours. If a story cannot be in film for a maximum of 90 minutes, then it's usually just drawn out & goes into too much boring detail. For example, this film had a lot of time with no speaking. If the visual doesn't tell much, cut it, or combine it with other speaking.I was bored to hell watching this and that was at a 60% faster speed while doing stuff on 2 of my other screens. (I have ADD & my mind goes fast.)Big fail for my interest & attention. Sure, I'm in a minority, but I wanted to put it out there.

898,vaultoverseer_15,A film I wish I loved,4/10,17 April 2018,"As someone who loves sci fi, esepcially philosophical sci-fi, I was looking forward to interstellar. And for the first half of the movie I was ready to call it a masterpiece. It was engaging and ejoyable on a surface level, but it also had great themes. I can't call the cinematography anything less than perfect, the score less than entrancing and the performances less then great. The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality. But that didn't bother me too much. The whole concept of Cooper having to, in a way choose between his family and the whole universe is interesting and explores human natural and love. It's just a shame then that they can't follow this theme through. Then there is one particular scene. I believe it is after they enter the wave planet. Anne Hathaway talks about love, and how it is everything. This speech is my biggest problem with the movie. The film wants to suggest somehow that his love for his family is key to solving the crisis on Earth. This doesn't really make sense and is not deep. The whole love thing being important becomes very prevelant in the film, but I think it isn't deep at all. Love being important can be summarised in a sentence, but the importance of love can be analysed. It isn't. If you don't care about philosophical elements of the film that's fine but the film keeps bringing back to it. I can turn my brain off in a movie, but when you ask me to think and I think what you're saying is stupid, then you have made a mistake. The whole ice planet scene and Matt Damon being introduced is just unneccessary. Yeah, Damon is the opposite to McCaughnehey in terms of ideals, but we don't need a villain. We don't need a fight scene and a villain like him. He's supposed to be a villain that we think is crazy but we ultimately find him to be relatable, however he just comes across as selfish. Wouldn't it be better if say Hathaway was constantly budding heads with Cooper, and then made a rash decision to try to go back to Earth that cost the crew and led to the docking scene? Rather than forced villain that prevents us from thinking and sympathising with his motives we would be able to philosiphise the situation. The ending is what gets me the most. You've probably heard all the criticism. It being a huge Ex-Machina is not my problem (although it is definitely). I think the ending betrays what the movie was building up to. Instead of leading to an answer or something that gives us more clues or ideas, it leads us to a scene that is obviously meant to pointlessly 2001 style enter this new dimension and conclude that love controls and binds everything. How deep. The ending being an ex-machina doesn't bother me for it being a huge coincidence, but it really doesn't make sense to end like this. Although I don't like the time scene, it is a perfect way to end the movie. The audience anticipates an outcome that they think about. They think about the ending which the movie should do, but once we know everything, what do we think about? I think the scene should've ended by showing Cooper reaching out to Murph to tell her to tell him not to go on the mission, and she responds, changing time in a way that is very vague so we don't really get what happens. Human desires could be explored better, but I see them as only partially shown, in a way where I see essays written about them that I feel were evaluated after analysing every scene. If it is shown only a bit then we can't explore it, and as such it can't be as philosophical ad pure sci-fi as say the golden standard 2001. It is enjoyable, but that is all Interstellar will ever be to me. Good but not great.",Interstellar
899,mkelly54,Perfect example of filming making at its best!!,10/10,18 November 2014,"This is what I'm always looking for in a movie: amazing and thought-provoking script, finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and CGI, inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) that connects viewers with the story, adding tension, passion, soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music.

900,lvanderwindt,Amazing (at basically) Everything!,10/10,19 May 2020,"I mean by this time we all know Christopher Nolan is one the best at what he does. This movie moved me so much, form beginning to end i felt like i was part of the story, the acting was amazing, the actors all fitted their role perfectly and you could really see how much time went into the making of this movie. The whole thing about sandstorms might be boring but it added such an amazing grizzled finish to it. You could see the regret Murph had when Cooper actually left and she was still angry at him. And all these other emotions that tied in so well with each other. The whole aspect of 'time' has always been something Christopher Nolan is interested in, he translates time into words and video which makes it so beautiful to look at if that makes any sense. The shots in this movie were just amazing, all of them but especially the ones in space and on the other planets. Perfectly enough people died throughout the movie to keep me on the edge of my seat. I really loved how Murph was also helping Professor Brand, this made the subplot on earth also interesting. I wasn't bored when they went to the subplots because they were all equally interesting to watch, there weren't to many which i hate because then at the end they don't have enough time to address and finish all the the subplots it's just an amazing perfect movie. It might be long but i feel like it should be. The storyline was interesting enough for me to watch it till the end. And wow the end... I guess i should've known that he was the 'ghost' but i didn't and i don't know why? The end made me bail my eyes out. And it's been long since that happened from a movie. The only little thing i didn't really get was WHY he needed to go to space? If i were him i would not have gone with the little information he got. He didn't know how long he was going to be gone? He didn't know if the 'Aliens' (if i can call them that) were like an actual thing. But i'm glad he did because otherwise the movie would've been real boring! Conclusion: perfect movie perfect actors perfect screenplay and perfect cinematography. Amen!",Interstellar

902,i-87537,This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment.,8/10,15 May 2020,"This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment. At this time, scientists found a wormhole near Saturn in the solar system, through which they could break the limitation of human ability and search for the chance to continue life in further outer space. An expedition team crossed the solar system through the wormhole. Their goal is to find a planet suitable for human migration. On this ship called ""Endurance"", the explorers are facing unprecedented challenges that human thought has never met. This ..This movie shows us that in the future life, science and technology are closely related to our life. In the boundless universe, there are still endless unknowns and mysteries waiting for us to explore and discover. For example, what kind of five-dimensional space, wormholes and so on, all of which are mysterious beings in the universe.
However, advanced technology is still needed to explore the basis of all this. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, we have already walked out of the era before and entered the era of advanced science and technology. The development of science and technology has brought great convenience to our life. We cannot do without science and technology. Science and technology are all around us. Any series of changes around us originate from science and technology. The benefits it brings us cannot be ignored, thanks to science and technology! It is the great power of science and technology that has changed our world and made our life better.
However, science and technology is also a double-edged sword. With the development of science and technology, we have indeed enjoyed many benefits of science and technology. However, the environment is deteriorating day by day and will eventually threaten our survival. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to be cautious and handle it carefully. While developing science and technology, we should not neglect the nature on which human beings depend for survival, and let the environment and science and technology develop together!
Let's face up to the power of science and technology, cultivate a heart that loves science, nature and science from an early age, contribute to the development of science and technology, and make our life better!",Interstellar
903,armaansm,ETERNAL FATHER DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP BEYOND A SCI-FI SAGA,9/10,15 July 2020,"Interstellar is another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Albeit it is a hardcore sci-fi cinema (with spaceships, wormholes, black holes, time variation due to astronomical differences) but, the main concept of this movie is the father-daughter bondage and this bondage faces perhaps the weirdest challenge due to the astronomical circumstances. This movie also shows a future food scarcity due to unsustainable life of human being and how science could take steps to prevent such debacles.The movie sets in a future dystopian world (about 50 years from now) where the human race is facing a severe extinction due to several downfalls and debacles due to unsustainable living. In 2067, only CROP is the last viable corp Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former skilled NASA pilot and engineer, now a farmer who faces trouble in his farmland due to corn blights and dust storm. He is a father of two: a 15-year-old son Tom (later Casey Affleck) and 10-year-old daughter Murphy (later Jessica Chastain). Cooper has a comparatively good bonding with his daughter who also has some engineering talent like him. Interestingly, this father-daughter duo finds an interesting gravity variation that leads to geographic coordinates. One day, they follow the coordinates and finds a secret NASA establishment headed by Cooper's former boss Professor Brand (Michael Caine). His daughter Dr Amelia (Anne Hathaway) is a promising team member of this NASA scientific establishment. They want a skilled engineer cum pilot for their upcoming mission and Cooper is the best choice for them. Cooper doesn't want to leave his family, especially his daughter. Murphy cries a lot to stop him. But, in order to save the human race, he agrees to participate in the mission. Murphy later becomes a scientist of NASA for the sake of her father. Professor Brand has two plans: Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel colonies into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet. At the initial stage, the astronauts were not sure which plan was viable. And for this reason, they face an enormous challenge from unthinkable sources and manipulative information. The only thinking of Cooper is to return to his daughter which lasts till the end of the movie.The acting of ensemble casts was well predicted and without mentioning anything. The chemistry between Matthew and Mackenzie Foy as young Murphy was superb, natural and emotional. The expressions of Jessica as elder Murphy to his father was outstanding as well. Matt Demon has a skill of playing both positive and negative roles with utmost sincerity.The cinematography and visual effects were outstanding. When the audiences watch this movie, they feel themselves on the land of those planets and that's the success of the technical team.This movie was equally critically and commercially successful and it is the 10th highest-grossing movie in 2014. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design. This film also won the BAFTA award for visual effect. Mackenzie Foy won the Teen's choice award",Interstellar
904,j889,"So, They Could Communicate with the Past, and They Failed to Tell Which Planet?",1/10,2 June 2019,"I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid.",Interstellar

906,rodolfoIII,Superb ...,9/10,8 November 2014,"Wow. This man does not do anything small. This movie is definitely Epic. Like others have said this is not an action flick, but more cerebral(like Inception). If you're looking for thinking, blow-half your mind experience and s'thing you're still thinking about the next am, then this is for you. Mr. Nolan definitely trying to out do himself, he comes close to succeeding that task.Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain give very good performances. Because the story is so well-woven and each an intricate part of one another is hard to explain the movie without giving much away. Essentially takes part in the future where the earth is just not able to support us anymore. These anomalies appear near or around Saturn, but turn out to be wormholes. This particular crew is sent through it what begins as explorers, end up being a tale of survival. It gets even more complicated as for each month for the crew is equal to 7years back on earth.I must admit, is quite a bit of thought put into this movie. Very impressive. Thank you again, Mr Nolan for frying a couple of my neurons in my brain. I expect nothing less. Good job.",Interstellar
907,LawrenceOfAlabama,Epic film that orbits too long.,8/10,9 November 2014,"Watching this film on IMAX opening weekend was an event I had to be a part of. The marketing, the actors, and the premise all had me anxious to see this film. I won't give away anything that would ruin the experience for others in this review.The acting was top notch. Mathew is batting 1000 in his recent roles. Supporting cast also fills out the film with lots of noticeable Nolan regulars.The effects in the film are also top notch. However if you are looking for worlds that awe and inspire you will probably be disappointed. This film is less about the voyage of the unknown and more about what the emotional impact is on those who travel it.I also want to add that most think Nolan is a tour-de-force with his thought provoking films. This one is pretty straight-forward. I figured out most of the devices long before their developments. Also I thought it had quite a bit of filler in-between the meat of the film. I felt like I aged along with our travelers. I know it's an epic film; does that mean it has to have a certain runtime to meet that criteria?Not that I am smarter than anyone else; I just want to add that this script is not on par with Memento or Inception.So to sum it up: Good film for a three hour tour. To me a shorter flight could have made it better. However the hype is nowhere near the experience. Gravity had better cinematography and scope (for a space quest) and this film has better emotional baggage for a trip to the unknown.One last note: The glass on his helmet was weaker than an I phone screen. What's up with that?",Interstellar
908,Nibbler007,Nolan overwhelms with a rock solid epic movie... again.,9/10,30 December 2014,"Quantum physics and relativity are not easy subjects to understand if you're not a physic. Buy I can assure you this is a plot with thought provoking topics, not typically Hollywood pop-corn film. My only criticism is about the dialog in this one: way too cheesy and when not too cheesy, too complex to absorb in matter of seconds. It is undeniable that Chris Nolan did a good and hard work on this film. Visuals are just a backup of the story, and not as Kubrick's 2001 nor Quaron's Gravity; which put visuals up front leaving script behind. This is another kind of film. This is ambitious (not pretentious as some critics said) The good old Nolan couldn't disappoint his long-term fans with his twists, his (sometimes) cold and detached way of telling the story. But he manages to wrap it up upon his own errors. I said there were mistakes, I felt it a little too much complex, but that's because the subject is complex itself. And when we leave the confusing dialog scenes and the detached direction, he turns back 180º and blushes all of us with his tenderness. That I felt a little awkward. But such a premise in the script, can't bring the movie down. The movie is solid as a rock. And it's unique in that level. Boy, you got to have the nuts to go and imagine this movie and put it all together like a puzzle. Well, it's C. Nolan, he has experience on that issue.Maybe not too far away, this film could be eclipsed by new scientific discoveries, theories refuted and so on. But nowadays, it seems scientifically accurate in terms of possibilities. This is not metaphysical, it's a possibility, like Schrodinger's cat. Like quantum mechanics.And I Know, most of the people didn't come to theater for that. They came for a Gravity approach or so.For me, it is a 9 because sometimes Nolan overwhelmed too much, and it's a long film for overwhelm people. But maybe that's my problem, I am not a quantum-physics scientist.. I Feel I could have enjoyed it more if I were one. But there's one thing for sure, he indulged me to go and learn more about this whole thing. I still enjoyed a lot and got carried away for the fantastic ending in my opinion. Greetings from Argentina!",Interstellar
909,ZChrisJ1995,A terrific addition to the science-fiction genre,9/10,11 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is arguably his most ambitious film yet, traveling beyond the relatively grounded settings of his Earth-based productions for a film of much more galactic proportions. The result is probably not his best film, but still an immensely impressive sci-fi production that will likely stand the test of time to be included as a solid example of the genre. The film follows the crew of the Endurance as they attempt to find a habitable planet to replace a gradually dying terra firma. Incorporated into this include wormholes, black holes, time dilation and extra-dimensional beings. Stylistically and structurally, the film is similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but also appears to draw inspiration from various other sci-fi classics such as ""Contact"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Unlike other modern sci-fi productions that seem to consist largely of unsubtle, action-oriented alien invasion flicks, ""Interstellar"" goes for a much more minimalist, slowly-paced approach, in accordance with its above-mentioned inspirations. The result is a film that is much more cerebral and emotionally-balanced, as is to be expected from Nolan. Matthew McConaughey delivers the role of Cooper without fault, effortlessly portraying a man who is forced to leave his young family behind, a period which becomes decades on Earth. This inner turmoil grows gradually across the narrative. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain also have their moments, but a lot of the cast exist largely as plot functions, their dialogue consisting predominantly of exposition. This is naturally expected though, for a film of this scope. A certain A-list actor appears roughly halfway through the film as well, and is also an unexpected highlight. As with other Nolan films, the score provided by Hans Zimmer, as well as the impressive visuals and cinematography flawlessly compliment each other, building up gently before reaching a grand crescendo in the film's metaphysical climax. Zimmer appears to go for a more lighter score this time around, as opposed to the intense, bass-driven soundtracks of 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception', which ultimately works well with the film's melancholy atmosphere. The film's third act introduces a lot of plot twists and turns, which inevitably requires some suspension of disbelief. The laws of physics, time and space are bent to their limitations, which may be intimidating and overwhelming for some audiences but never failed to impress me and others due to the sheer scope and imagination of the final sequences' architects. 'Interstellar' is a mind-bending journey into the far reaches of the universe, as well as an emotional expose of the lengths the human race is capable of going to in order to ensure its survival. Though perhaps relying too much on previous sci-fi classics, particularly in its final act, it doesn't exactly reach the heights of some of Nolan's previous films. This isn't saying much however. The film's ambition and concept, its cast, visuals and score all will inevitably ensure that 'Interstellar' stands out in a wave of mediocre modern science fiction films, as well as all sci-fi films in general.",Interstellar

Out cold inside a black hole, he yearns, and remembers. It is his daughter--back on Earth that he had left with a promise. A promise he now knows he can't keep. He has failed.**************************************************This is a film not just about parenthood. It is anthropological in its canvas. Humankind is struggling to survive, and we see all of our species' defining features here. It is about humanity's best and worst. 'Mann' lies to ensure his survival. Cooper braves a black hole to send Brand on her way, wryly quoting the Newton's third law, ""The only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind."" Brand still loves someone who she hasn't seen in decades, and is pulled light years towards him. We may be three dimensional beings, but 'love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.' For a moment, I am reminded of 'The Dark Knight Rises' when Mann says, ""Our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration."" The film seems to be an ode to Murphy's law--whatever that can happen will happen—as almost every single thing that could have gone wrong with the mission goes wrong; and to the Darwin's law of adaptability, when Cooper and Brand adapt to the ever increasing complexities of their mission to stay alive.""Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future."" Cooper's predicament is universal. He chooses 'not' to be merely a ghost. He rises above his immediate goals in favor of his future ones. He wonders. He plans. Thus he achieves. ""Nature is not evil.""Cooper boldly goes where no one has ever gone before--inside the singularity. For him, Murphy's law is not a pessimistic take on nature, it is about fairness. That is why he does not give up hope for the future of Earth's remaining inhabitants, and vaults into the 'gentle' singularity of the black hole, even though he had no way of relaying the quantum information just yet. ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""Dylan Thomas' famous poem is heard reverberating throughout. And that is how the action goes. Every character, even Tom fights to save the crop he grew. Cooper docks into a wildly spinning Endurance defying everyone around him, because he just couldn't give up. Humanity fights hard to survive across galaxies, as time watches.""I'm not afraid of death..., I'm afraid of time.""Cooper's primary struggle is against time. He wants to save the future. He is left maimed by relativity, but he continues on, not caring for the costs. He is haunted by his memories, but he manages not to become one himself.****************************************Cooper's survival instincts kick in. He realizes the time tesseract is not a prison, but a gateway to peer into time. He watches his daughter stare forlornly towards the bookcase. Can he communicate with her in time? The harder he tries, the bitter the results are. He sees himself walking out the door, leaving her bundled up in her fury. He realizes what he has to do.

912,vincent-malisse,space time in an original package,6/10,12 January 2015,"Interstellar had some very interesting topics, for one that we're ruining our planet. It's probably the closest thing to reality in the entire movie, but it's worth taking at least that message.Interstellar reminded me of the grandeur shots of 2001: A Space Odyssey, music included. The power chords blew through the speakers in the cinema was quite deafening. But I can only say the cinematographically speaking, the movie is excellent. The only thing I miss here is some overview shot of the solar (or black hole) system they've entered, yet they make it up by at least letting you see a (limited) view of the planets they visit. Which brings me to the next topic, because if they would have spent less time on useless discussion, plot lines and just plane slow story development and more into the outline of the galaxy, the movie would probably by far better. Yes, the slow story is very, very annoying and I frequently had the feeling: ""move along already!""The relativity of time was nicely put into view though I have question marks about some presentations of it. Eg. If I was a scientist I would visit the planet closest to the black hole as last. Since they lose years by the minute the consequences of something going wrong is far too high. The other two scientists could die, humanity could have been extinct, ... I also wander if the scientist on board of the Endurance would have kept his sanity during the long waiting time.Also they were pretty close to the remaining scientists and could have sent signals to keep contact.When they slingshot by the black hole Gargantua Cooper falls into the black hole and this is were I found the movie totally going off. Even if he would survive until he reached the event horizon from that point his body would literally be ripped apart. When he reaches the library I a had feeling of utter annoyance of how the story was developing.I must admit it was clever of the director on how they pass back and forth through time and how Cooper showed his daughter what to do, but the nagging annoying feeling didn't leave me and even came back when Cooper woke up on the space station that appears to be close to Saturn and which didn't make sense to me. Earth was seriously lacking resources so how were they able to create such a flourishing space station at that point in space and in less then 100 years (Cooper's daughter is about to die, so even if she reached a very old age, the time span between him leaving and the building of the space station is less than 10 decades.)An uplifting from other space movies must have been TARS and CASE. Not only have they got an original design, but I was silently expecting one of them to crash or behave erratically like in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Alien and that didn't happen.All in all Interstellar is not a bad movie, be it annoyingly slow at times.",Interstellar
913,peter-eldon,Gravity Saves The World!,10/10,10 November 2014,"The last feature film ever to be projected on 15/70mm IMAX film with breath-taking and eye- catching cinematography composed with a reinvented Hans Zimmer soundtrack. Christopher Nolan's 9th feature film is a modern sci-fi blockbuster about time travel (the relative theory), humanity, society, evolution, nature, science, life, history and the future of The Planet Earth. Physicist Kip Thorne whose work the screenplay is based on describes the story as ""based on warped space-time – the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans"". Texas native Matthew McConaughey outshines most of the cast as he usually does as Cooper, an NASA educated southern farmer in this epic space journey about saving the world. Some of the impressive shots were right up there with when watching Star Wars for the first time as a young boy. I found myself gobsmacked and just starring at the incredible work cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema produced for this master piece of art. Not to be so surprised as Christopher Nolan used Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977) as well as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Blade Runner (1982) for inspiration for this modern day adventurous science fiction movie. A very intelligent produced film that entertains you, asks questions and will probably make you shed a tear. Interstellar should rake in the Oscars at the up coming Academy Awards (The Oscars 2015), and is also set up so it can be continued, I sure hope a film series is made out of it. / Peter A Eldon. 2014-11-03.",Interstellar

918,bucekcrk,Awsome,9/10,26 August 2021,"It's a really cool movie.Again nolan impressed me, the concept he gave was always unique and fantastic.Indeed, this movie may be a bit confusing at first for some who watch it, but believe me you will be given a plot twist that is really unthinkable and an absolute explanation for the concept given by Nolan.Moreover, the additional scoring from Hans Zimmer is very dramatic, able to blend and make this movie is so INCREDIBLE.

919,marzolian,Major disappointment,6/10,16 November 2014,"I didn't like it nearly as much as I hoped.**** SPOILERS AHEAD **** The first 20-30 minutes were a great setup - earth dying, society turning its back on technology to focus on survival. Scenes reminiscent of the Dust Bowl, but then in the middle there's this modern ruggedized laptop computer. Wow. And having the girl be the scientific one was a very nice touch.After that, it started to go off the rails. The sentry robot was preposterous. It was obvious which characters were going to die and in what order. The first spaceship launch was cool, showed two booster stages with immense fuel tanks. Then, once they're past the wormhole, the same ship is able to land on a planet with higher gravity, and take off, with no external fuel tanks? I just couldn't get into the ""tesseract"". As Neal Tyson pointed out, if he can make objects move that way, then why not just write his daughter a note? Wouldn't it be easier to fix what's wrong with the Earth rather than repopulate a different one? It reminded me of other movies, most of which I liked better: 2001, Deep Impact, Contact, Silent Running (early 1970's).Finally, it was just too long. I kept looking at my watch, always a bad sign). Some of the science in ""Gravity"" was just as preposterous, but at least that one kept me interested.I'll give it a C for effort, maybe a B-. And I really did like the part where the daughter is struggling on earth at the same ""time"" that her dad is fighting to survive on his planet.",Interstellar
920,AlukardsCastle,"""In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind.""",10/10,8 November 2014,"-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side.That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt.In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll.",Interstellar
921,Allen-Uncle-Mont-Williams,Boring And Overrated...,2/10,3 April 2015,This has got to be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen...I came into this thinking it was going to be as epic as everyone kept saying it was...Boy was I wrong...The performances were alright...Jessica Chastain was the only one who truly stood out as far as good acting...In fact...She's the only reason i even bothered to finish watching the movie...Word is that the special effects were amazing...I disagree...I saw effects that were blatantly stolen from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Mission To Mars...Word is that the movie is quite exciting...Once again...I disagree...With the exception of a scene that has to do with a very big tidal wave...This movie was boring as boring can get...And lastly...I was not at all impressed with the guest appearance by Matt Damon...His character was yet another blatant rip off from a film called Sunshine directed by Danny Boyle...Anybody remember Pinbaker..??This movie is by far...Christopher Nolan's weakest work ever...Interstellar was boring and extremely overrated...And that's all there is too it...,Interstellar
922,jonruff108,Nolan's most ambitious film reaches into human philosophy and features the most incredible special effects ever seen in a movie,9/10,7 November 2014,"As I walked out of the Cinemark IMAX theater my brain was still attempting to piece together strings of words but it seemed I had forgotten how to do this. I felt sick inside yet, at the same time, overwhelmed with emotion. I was speechless. I felt like I had just witnessed the most complete and satisfying movie I had ever seen in my life.Interstellar is something I have never seen before; this is a once in a lifetime movie. I had been waiting for this movie ever since it was announced Christopher Nolan was attached to direct and co-write it. The nearly three year wait was more than worth it. Christopher Nolan has done the impossible, again. Not only has he once more outdone himself but he has changed the blockbuster, arguably, for the third time after doing so with the Dark Knight and Inception.I wouldn't go as far as to say this movie is indeed a blockbuster because it's really so much more than that, as one would expect from Christopher Nolan. Sure, there is a fair amount of action, and when it's present on screen it is indeed incredible and furiously exciting. The special effects are literally breathtaking. Last year I hailed Gravity to no end for it's astounding CGI but Interstellar has brought it to the next level. Every single CGI shot looks 100% real. It was jaw dropping. This is by far the most glorious visually awe-inspiring film I've (once again) seen.As for the rest of the technical parts of the movie, all are currently unmatched in 2014. Replacing Wally Pfister as cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose previous works include Her and the Fighter, both of which were beautifully filmed movies. Hoytema works with such confidence behind the camera that I felt completely immersed in the movie. Every shot was gorgeous, which is something I can't say for many movies. I really can't stress how well Hoytema was able to capture the immense vastness of space and the infinitesimal size of the earth and humans. There are also many shots reminiscent of 2001 (it never feels copied, though) and inspiration shines through them.The sound design and are top notch. The IMAX theaters really emphasize how epic in scope this movie is. It is ear shattering, chest rumbling, and incredibly loud. The detail is astounding. If there is only one movie you will ever see in IMAX, make it this one. Interstellar was made to be seen this way. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful and terrifying all at once, which is how I would also describe space itself. Zimmer has created a completely original and unconventional soundtrack that simply brings the movie to near perfection. It's one of his most unique and haunting scores yet.There have been talks about Matthew McConaughey's performance not being up to par, and, well, I honestly couldn't disagree more. Is it Oscar worthy? Perhaps a nomination at least, but really it doesn't matter. He was dazzling. Anne Hathaway also gives the best performance of her career and this is another example of how her talent has just recently been truly discovered. Mackenzie Foy, McConaughey's in-movie daughter, was excellent as well. Child actors starring in adult movies doesn't often work but here it does. She was just as good, if not better, than both McConaughey and Hathaway. The rest of the cast, including Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, and Casey Affleck, are great as well, even if not terribly important.The thing that is really splitting audiences and critics alike is the screenplay and writing. As usual with Nolan's films, the screenplay ranges from very good to, lets just say decent. There's a rare few lines of dialogue that are sometimes just awkward but for the most part it stays realistic and natural. The exposition, much like Inception, is great (as in there's a lot of it). However, unlike Inception, characters aren't constantly explaining the plot but instead the science, which I will admit is at times overwhelming. The film deals with huge scientific theories and ideas that are beyond the average viewer. The film does its best to keep everyone on the same page, though, which in itself is an impressive achievement. Overall, I'm pleased with the screenplay but it doesn't match the magic of some of Nolan's older work like Memento, the Prestige, or the Dark Knight.As far as the story is concerned, it reaches true ""hardcore"" science fiction, much like 2001 did. The final thirty minutes or so had me absolutely floored and blown away. Most of the movie stays within the realms of factual science, thanks to genius physicist and black hole junkie Kip Thorne, who is credited as executive producer and was a major factor in creating realist visions of the wormholes and black holes as well as solving equations to determine certain plot points. The ending, however, is purely theoretical and Christopher Nolan's imagination. The results are dumbfounding. I haven't been this shocked in science fiction since 2001.However, since the ending is subjective and completely unconventional there will be a difference of opinions which is most likely what Nolan was going for. Unlike 2001 where a lot was left up to the viewer's interpretation, I believe there is a true and definitive answer to everything that happens in Interstellar. In a way, the movie does a great job of giving you just enough information to make it enjoyable instead of frustrating and confusing. Some people prefer to have the answers handed to them but others, like myself, prefer to interpret it our own ways and within our understanding. Interstellar does a little of both, which I thought was appropriate given the situation.Interstellar is Nolan's most ambitious and epic film yet and is going to stay with me for days. It leaves you with just enough thought provoking material that it leaves you completely satisfied and fulfilled.",Interstellar
923,spock-386-815174,Tried and failed,4/10,9 November 2014,"What is it with our directors that they fail to come with a SF movie being renewing,different,special. Nolan might be good for certain aspects but is copying from left and right ideas and puts them in a new movie which is supposed to have us reflect on our being human and respecting our planet. The wormhole equals the monolith of 2001. The binary messages equal the messages in Contact ( moreover with the same actor ). Some of the visuals equal scenes in Gravity...and so on and on. The movie is too long and too cheesy.If I compare this to 2001, 2001 will top it , compare it to Contact , Contact will top it , and even Gravity with a thin-line story will top it. No sorry despite the efforts put in this which I have to aknowledge it does not deliver the goods I want from a SF-movie. I sincerely hope that some day some director will have the guts to take on a Jack Vance novel , now that would be something different . So Steven Spielberg , what are you waiting for ?

924,santasa99,Trump in space: America First,1/10,13 May 2017,"Little bit too late ? No, it's always advisable to squash the garbage if and when it falls into your path. Nolan brothers promised, as James Rocchi put it, ""outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Interstellar, as absolute ""A""production, is one of the worst films ever made by Hollywood ! It fails in every department, both science & fiction (fantasy) in ""SciFi"" are ridiculous, but that was never good enough reason for failure: many ""SciFi"" films failed in science- fiction but excelled as films in story telling, acting, plot, details, dialogues, etc. This one is so awful that I can't decide where to begin. If I could, most obvious starting point would be it's infantile plot and dialogues (love ""transcends the limits of time and space"", ),... no, it would be idea of faux all-American heroism, patriotism masked as faux concern for ""human race"", faux American superior technology, and mythological unshakable will to go forward in the face of ultimate, apocalyptic adversity - who is better suited for ""riding"" NASA's rocket through the ""wormhole"" so that he can save the world, then white-Christian farmer-engineer-pilot from Texas !? As David Edelstein writes, ""Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic — The Grapes of Wrath II: The New Vintage"". Eh, the amount of pathos: patriotism, family, American mythology & heroics - I was, I am, all cowed ! Only great act of entire movie is Michael Caine's dying scene, but you have to try really hard to remove his Dylan Thomas reciting from your mind first.Ehhhh... Cooouuupeh, take us to the starsssssseh !Deus Ex McConaughey",Interstellar
925,dentrex,A Frozen Cloud of Horse Poopy,1/10,26 August 2018,"Dear God, what is this? I could not believe what I was seeing after all the positive reviews. I watched on Amazon video, and thank goodness for that because I would have demanded my money back at a theater.This 'film' is a naked excercise in making an IMAX film for the sake of screwing the public out of more money to... watch it on IMAX. I tell you, having experienced the format live, once you get past the ""gee whiz factor"" of a ginormous screen in your face, it's just a movie. And to further insult my sensibilities it's likely the last IMAX movie to actually use the large format physical film. I'll bet that cost a fortune for three hours of inanity.I thought Nolan was a great director before this. He likely still is but this material is way out of his reach. We don't have any of the 'great' directors anymore in my opinion, but he's one of the very good ones. But when I heard organ music cues at certain points in this movie, I cringed at the Kubrick-ian references. Kubrick would have walked out of this 3 hour morass.The plot holes are akin to a piece of swiss cheese. Good acting is absolutely wasted with trite dialogue and scenery-chewing to the point of choking. Long speeches about love... and other stuff that was supposed to sound monumental and mind-blowing. Ugh. I kept thinking that Michael Caine's character's last lines as he died would be ""...at least I don't have to look at that awful script anymore"". And as events in the film transpired, I was constantly saying ""Wait...what? Huh? How did the - I mean, where... which?"" And of course there's the ""mysterious ending"" that will keep amateur you-tubers in business for years explaining.As far as scientific accuracy, first let me say that I had a whole year of college physics, and have a dear friend who actaully had a master's degree in that subject and had studied quantum mechanics and relativity, and I do I have a conceptual understanding of the matter at hand. This movie really pushes the envelope in that department. All that time dilation stuff is not reconciled properly. Frozen clouds? The film makers went to great pains to point that out as the 'one thing' that wasn't accurate. Oh yeah? I could devote an entire review to that, and I won't.The sad part is that the special effects were 10 stars all the way. The oscar was well deserved. The sadder part is that I smell a sequel at some point. A huge disappontment, a waste of great acting talent, and another case of overblown Hollywood hype gone viral, but come home to roost in the bargain bin at the dollar store. Where it belongs.",Interstellar
926,Jorge-627-653533,What a movie!,10/10,6 February 2018,"I wanted to write a review for this movie for awhile and after watching it again last night I made up my mind.First of all, we are talking about the highest rated movie of the last 7 years and currently the #30 film on the all-time list (hopefully it would go even higher with the passing of the years). It's a big deal right but I wished it was higher, because this is Nolan's best film in my honest opinion, yes better than Inception or any film from The Dark Knight trilogy or The Prestige and Memento, don't get the wrong idea I like all of these films and Nolan has to be my favorite director. I gotta say I was expecting more from Dunkirk and I'm in a way glad that people gave it a lower score compared to most of his other films despite the praise from most of the film critics!Interstellar has to be Nolan's best film, where should I begin from? The score? The story? McConaughey's performance? The Graphics? It was an excellent movie, lasted almost 3 hours but I wish there was more to see.",Interstellar
927,cineastFGD,Every hour of that movie feels like seven years on earth,1/10,27 August 2015,"OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression ""Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred""). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable.",Interstellar

934,jacobsperling,Specatcular. Christopher Nolan does it again.,10/10,7 January 2019,"A phenomenal film. The plot is incredibly emotional, beautiful, and thrilling. The action is spectacular, the film is visually amazing, emotional, and superbly acted, with great performances from all (McConaughey is perfect), and MacKenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain, and Ellen Burstyn (who all play the same character at different stages of her life), are perfectly portraying the same personality. It's not perfect, but Christopher Nolan has produced another masterpiece. He is truly incomparable. A notable point about this film is that the emotion is so impactful while the action is so thrilling.

935,aushro,After experiencing this masterpiece now it's hard to continue my respect & believe both for the Oscar nomination & win..,10/10,6 April 2020,"For me Christopher nolan's best movie is still Inception. But interstellar this is also not a normal movie.
It's not only a masterpiece for scifi genre.it has everything to makes it better then Aliens, 2001:a space odyssey, Back to the future even emotionally it's comparable with Forrest Gump,American beauty etc etc.
And there is also many many things to say about this one of the greatest movie of all time.Maybe I can start to write but also maybe can't end it.
How the lead actor not nominated for oscar minimus!!!
How many movie u saw in ur life which have a background music like this??
Oscar comitte need to repair I think.

936,q-85184,"It's an endless abyss, and it's also the place of dim light",9/10,27 April 2020,"Wandering in space, the ""black hole"" that makes all scientists avoid is like a metaphor of real human nature: people are often not so good beyond what they see on the surface, but they are not as bad as they think. Everyone has seven passions and six desires, as well as selfishness. Therefore, all good and bad are not so simple. The difference is, which is more critical?
Dr. mace, who is alone on the unmanned planet, is waiting for rescue with a glimmer of hope. The long loneliness makes him more eager to see his own kind again. The so-called: stay dead and be young. When death is near, fear gives birth to an unprecedented force, which may be a strong belief to live no matter what. However, the complexity of human nature is also here. There must be boundless darkness hidden in the positive. When too strong desire for survival becomes the ultimate goal of life, good human nature will be squeezed to almost invisible.
When the original ""be good for others"" becomes ""be good for yourself"" generous giving becomes cruel plunder! Compared with animals fighting for survival, human beings have to rationalize their inhumanity.
Since there are people like Max, there will be people like Cooper who are willing to sacrifice themselves. This may be the way to balance the world. When Cooper faces the black hole, the expected impact is also shocking! The fragments that can't be dodged are like innumerable fears inside. When fear is useless, you can only go through them and wait for the results.
A black hole that no one has ever dared to cross is not necessarily an endless abyss, but also the place of dim light. So death is also called ""past life"". People are very fragile, said no; but people are also very strong, desperate valley will open a stubborn flower of hope.",Interstellar
937,Icons76,"Interstellar makes for great entertaining show, but lacks depth",6/10,26 November 2015,"I finally watched brilliant director's Christopher Nolan, ""Interstellar"", and, i found it rather enjoyable, extremely well photographed, with a style, and, skills rich of the uncommon finesse, so typical of Nolan's filmography, of which i am such a great admirer. I love ""Memento"", his first major film in 2001, starring a phenomenal Guy Pearce, and, i have seen all the following efforts, always finding them, extremely accomplished, and mature, even when going for more commercial fare, such as the Batman's franchise: in fact, i thought that Nolan managed always to bring his vision, and, his greater talent to the purpose of creating a major movie, aimed to all mainstream audiences, intelligently well made, and, way above the standards, while always maintaining a narration rich of invention, and, creative, innovative visuals, and, most of all, with top notch scripts. I also loved ""Inception"" which had gotten, if i remember, a mixed reception. I found it extremely clever, written with uncommon genius, and, considering not only the more obvious needs of glossy, wide distributed entertainment, but resulting as a great film shot with a virtuoso direction, of mind blowing, and powerful effect, not only presenting an unique, and appalling show, but, also handling feelings, and character's development, with an extremely touching grip. I did not feel as excited, watching ""Interstellar"", though, a movie i did not find bad by any means, but, that, for me, lacked the same profound, powerful strength, Nolan had previously shown, even in the Batman's movies, always so infused with his impeccable vision. ""Interstellar"" feels like a great show, but falls rather flat at the end, lacking emotional, cohesive force, and, feeling unaccomplished, despite its incredibly skilled crew, and, budget, its powerful presentation, and, special effects.I think the script lacks Nolan's usual personal, and, deeper attention to all characters, and, often relies strangely on some solutions, that feel derivative, and, very little original. Again, I will keep it short and sweet, since there are already so many reviews on here, that have said it all already, some feeling the same i have, and many others, who have instead appreciated the show. This movie for me failed to bring the same, unique, great direction, and writing, one would expect by Nolan, and, over all, it feels like since the get go, the main idea wasn't the most interesting, nor the most innovative, and, its further development did not help to make it into the great movie, one would have expected. However, it needs also to be said, that, considering the painful offer, and, the even worse level of production value, and new ideas, found in most American movies, in the past few years, even a not such accomplished, and, not so inspired film, such as ""Interstellar"", does make for, at least, a more well produced, and, entertaining, big budget, genre's production.",Interstellar
938,loyolite,Relativity slows down time in the movie till you get bored !,6/10,9 December 2014,"OK, I get it ! It's a Nolan movie so everyone hu-ha about it. Well actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times. This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long. Maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would have been great !

So well written, directed and acted that it really makes you feel you are there. Matthew McC is the best he has ever been in this role as are many of the stellar cast. The story builds slowly and is complicated which makes it even better on the second and subsequent viewings. The effects are brilliant. All in all a superb piece of filmmaking and entertainment. Kudos to everyone involved.

940,hamass-mujadid,The Eccentric Edification,9/10,20 January 2015,"Let's start like this: If Sandra Bullock can get nominated for ""Best Actress"" for Gravity, and if Alfonso Cuaron can get nominated for ""Best Director"" for Gravity (then actually win it), and if Gravity can itself get nominated for ""Best Motion Picture"" together with so many other so-called ""Oscar"" nominations, then why the heck should Interstellar be left desolate? What is the jury trying to prove, that Nolan can suck it up, that however incandescent he comes up in every other project, he'll still be entertained with comments on obsession and insanity? I mean look at IS's script once for god's sake (I'm really starting to doubt the ""god"" part here.) Nolan literally infuses the most divine elements of time and cosmology with compassion, stress, and culminates at cyclical points—there is no end; you can't tell what part of the movie you liked most. I read some reviews on Interstellar stating that the film can be compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Are you serious? It's not like I'm blindly in love with this guy but Nolan is far more prodigious than Stanley Kubrick. That guy was a mastermind and surely far ahead of his time, but Nolan, don't ask me, Nolan doesn't know what time is, because once you know time, you have to conform to it, and that is ""friction"" to apotheosis. Interstellar is something that is not directed towards mass audience; it's engendered only for those who have this innate sensibility and passion for assimilation, who are genuinely dissatisfied with the regular course of life and seek exploration, and who are simply ""non-conformists"". The movie isn't a sci-fi, although this view is relative. It builds itself on that premise but it indicates and enforces concepts of love, family, nostalgia, care-taking, and acute improvisations. The plot is not simple at all; that's why I'm saying this movie is not for everybody. If you're a professional critic, or a dilettante, sure, go ahead, but if you wish to see it only because your dad keeps your pockets filled, back off. As an advocate of philosophy, I'm not usually very keen to make empirical comparisons and judgments. But here, I think they're really necessary. Gravity (2013) was nominated for ten Oscar nominations. I'm sure as hell I loved that movie but now that I've seen Interstellar, Gravity seems so incompetent to me now. Why isn't Nolan nominated for direction? Where's the ""Best Original Screenplay"" nomination? Where's the ""Best Picture"" nomination? I'm ready to compromise on cinematography and best actor (Matthew McConaughey pulled off an intense performance, but still, you know, you can't get everything) but the rest is utterly unequivocal. The way Nolan has produced and directed movies throughout his career, I don't think anybody else can ever pull out projects with this much vigor. I'm sure Nolan isn't materialistic, else he would have committed suicide by now, but come on, he must be credited with things other than praises and complements. I mean who actually goes to NASA, Space X, takes courses on ""relativity"" from California Institute of Technology, and consults physicists? Justify his endeavors god dammit. The script is something like this. In a world with imminent collapse, a former pilot agrees on a venture in collaboration with NASA to travel through the wormhole in search for other planets with ""survival"" ingredients. That's the synopsis. Now let's move forward in ""time"" and see Cooper in the black hole in ""extra-dimension"" where he witnesses his daughter's experiences (most of them with past-Cooper) in response to messages sent by the future-him. That's how mankind's survival is ensured, through an unlimited odyssey into stakes and gorges, and through devising solutions through incessant painstaking, and humanitarianism. Nolan isn't just a director, writer, or producer, he is a philanthropist. He is the unhatched egg to perfectionism. Too bad, the old-fashioned assessors nominating and awarding mostly the ""lamest"" movies of the year are too ignorant to appreciate aesthetes and aesthetics.",Interstellar
941,mrvanin,"Beautiful pictures, moronic story.",3/10,9 July 2018,"This is some kind of liberal's rescue story for saving mankind from themselves as a result of their environmental sins. As is all too common these days, the script-writing was left to terminally-lazy intellects who could simply not make the effort to write even a vaguely credible physical background to a poorly contrived plot. So we are left with what will become one of the most infamously badly construed sciency ""love stories"" (which is only the director's opinion - and he failed at getting that right as well). This movie was a massive disappointment.

942,Callum_Hofler,A Colossal Achievement For All Involved,10/10,8 November 2014,"Interstellar is what I would consider one of the most ambitious films within modern cinema, as well as one of the most thoroughly affecting; an emotional onslaught, contrasted with some of the greatest visuals ever put to screen. Whilst it doesn't match the brilliance and spectacle of some of Christopher Nolan's finest films, including Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception, Interstellar comes dreadfully close to perfection, due to its glorious performances, brilliant sound design, immensely well-executed pacing, an emotional core that resonates with viewers of all ages, and a score from Hans Zimmer that reflects the emotion and wonder on screen with acute grandeur.The lead performance from Matthew McConaughey is something of wonder; a pitch-perfect performance from an exquisite actor. His chemistry with his co-stars is all fantastic, from Mackenzie Foy, who plays his daughter in the film, to Michael Caine, who plays the scientist and theorist Doctor Brand, to Anne Hathaway's powerful and resonant portrayal of a character often flawed, Brand. The movie encompasses both sentimental and scientific plots and ideas, metaphors and themes, and often executes them with a grace and harmony that is not so often found with modern sci-fi films; Interstellar proves that a film of immense scope can still suitably and aptly focus on the seemingly mundane relationship between father and daughter, but execute it with heart, soul and power, to both contrast as well as work together.The film encompasses a number of jaw-dropping moments, including a lift off sequence which I could call one of the most compelling and brilliantly shot sequences of film I've ever had the grace of viewing. The brilliant and loud sound design echoes throughout the cinema, shaking the seats and the viewers, and it allows the audience member to fully engross themselves in the current, dangerous predicament; it's thrilling and all encompassing viewing for all. As the visual effects break ground, McConaughey and Nolan remind us all that the true story that one should be enthralled within is that of the story between father and daughter, and that father's fight to not only get back to his daughter, but to save the human race from near-imminent extinction.The film also works to build themes around the idea of time; that time is not guaranteed, but a resource that is exhausted at a certain point. One must always be careful and moderate how they spend and use up their time, as it may run out far quicker than anyone could imagine. This is especially evident in scenes where Cooper and Brand are on planets in which a single hour spent examining and rummaging about on the surface translates to seven years of time gone by on Earth. Eventually, Cooper decides that it is best to conserve time, so that he may one day see his daughter again, but not all can go so swimmingly, or as well as he can hope.Interstellar is amassed of a number of spectacular plot twists, turning and shifting into all manner of areas, encompassing ideas and ambitions in a single cinematic fare only dreamt about before. The Nolan brothers are unafraid to spread their wings and invest their resources into the most far reaching of concepts; and whilst perhaps it doesn't always succeed, as is the case in the neatly packaged and partially unsatisfying final ten minutes of the picture, they mostly manage to triumph in their intentions.As is customary with Nolan pictures, many of the female characters have a few inexplicably poor one liners and exposition-like pieces of dialogue here and there, bringing us out of the film. Sometimes the story just plain doesn't make sense, and realism is sacrificed for ambition. But perhaps this is something to treasure; who cares if we don't have the most realistic of films, if what we get is something undeterred from going to wherever it sees fit and justified. Interstellar reminded me of why I go to the cinemas to firsthand witness films on the big screen; it gave me an experience which I cried in, was enthralled by, and ultimately, was stunned by all throughout. A brilliant cinematic achievement.9.4/10This was a brief summary of my thoughts. Check out my elongated review on www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",Interstellar

Interstellar is a long one, but it never seemed that way to me.There is science, yes, but Nolan connects it with humanity (a father's desire to see his family again) to such a degree that the viewer remains hooked, whether or not they fully grasp the science behind it (speaking for myself, at least). The score will remain with me. It is unique.I've read that some people find the film to ""cold"", but as mentioned above, the themes of family acted as a countermeasure to me and had me hooked on an emotional level.Cast, very good, direction, well above average. The concept itself and the tackling of such a vast subject? Bold and unforgettable.

946,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,An everyman with a galactic dilemma: his children or humanity,10/10,21 December 2014,"At minute three, I was already captivated by the fate of this farmer, who is a loving father and who used to be a NASA pilot. Cooper has to make tough choices, and for this, we admire and pity him all at once. He is the every-day man and hero. And then there's all that kinetic dust and its breaking-nature-law's mystery and the corn... Definitely the Father-daughter relationship takes the story to another dimension: a place where love transcends space and time. We get to experience that Love is more powerful than all the laws of physics and nature. In general, you will love the way Nolan weaves the plot with the human factor: relationships and attachments; the ""fascination"" sequences: where we learn what Cooper is passionate about; the suspense of planetary exploration challenges; and the shaking emotional moments. This memorable story will take you out of this world! At times the movie feels like a lot of talking, but that's necessary in the long run to understand what's going to happen and why it happens. This is a very science-based movie, so we need the exposition.I loved the screen magic! Christopher Nolan's camera shots will make you as if you were right in the middle of the action. You will feel you are in command. It's almost like a 4-D experience almost! Hold on tight! The very first time I watched this film I thought it was a puzzle and very long. But it left me intrigued. I went to watch it a second time. Then a third. In the end, I watched this movie about 27 times. I love how the actors actually get into spaceships: no blue-screen, but real things. CGI is used in the smartest possible way: we get the vivid illusion of speed and gravity! The film touches our senses and our hearts.Matthew McConaughey's performance (Cooper) here is powerful and it's beautiful. He is brave and tough, but he can cry and sob. He is a likable and empathetic character. Michael Caine is a perfect match for the role of the scientist with a secret and noble agenda... Anne Hathaway (Dr. Brand) is the logical and controlled scientist that brings a balance of beauty and loveliness to the cast of characters. And Jessica Chastain is absolutely poignant! The rest of the supporting cast make this story a touching and galactic! I enjoyed the character growth. This film fulfills the promise of drama, adventure, science fiction, and suspense. And as bonus, you'll enjoy poetry and a breathtaking musical score. You will be moved, you will be inspired, you will be entertained. Cheers.",Interstellar
947,Semmy-tones,Interstellar – An Astronomical Achievement,10/10,23 January 2015,"There is something deeply haunting about this film: A quality that Christopher Nolan seems to be able to instill into his movies – an unforgettable quality that keeps you thinking about his films for days after you've seen them. I found it to be the same case with The Prestige, with Inception and Memento to name a few. But Interstellar is differentSomehow it feels as if a climax has been reached with a certain style of direction; there is a culmination of themes that have ran through other Nolan movies; mystery, curiosity, exploration, sacrifice BUT, what makes this stand out over the others is the haunting quality of love that pervades the entire movie. It isn't at all in the sentimental or romantic sense, but an underlying pulse that builds and builds and finally comes to the fore in the last quarter of the film; as if it creeps in through the back door and suddenly makes itself undeniably known; not only physically, but also spiritually... And that's when you become desperately moved by the humanity that is portrayed through the cast; that's where the message comes together loud and clear, that this is not really a Sci Fi movie at all, but a deeply poignant film about what it is to really be human, shot through two parallel stories; in fact in two parallel dimensions where time and space are trumped by the energy of Love – an energy that is embodied in every human being. Interstellar is a multidimensional, multi-layered expression of creativity at its finest, filled with intelligence and sensitivity presenting an infinity of possible interpretations to the viewer. Like many of Christopher Nolan's movies; it makes you THINK. But not only that: I found myself profoundly touched on a very emotional level at the rawness with which the paradox of human existence was expressed – in a nutshell; love versus fear of annihilation. The characters in the film are split between those who are motivated by love and those who are motivated by fear – and within this, there are those who begin with one motivation and end with the other. It is a film that explores the very core of humanity; presenting such qualities as faith, hope, courage, sacrifice; and on the flip side anger, betrayal, hopelessness and remorse, all against the backdrop of the unknown emptiness of space.I felt that the message of the film was really about choice. The choice of whether to remain in fear which emerges as a result of threat to our survival, or to choose the higher frequency of love, which means to override the survival instinct and take risks based on faith. If I could write an equation to express the perfection of this film it would be expressed as 10/10Flawless!",Interstellar

950,B RUBBLE,"Okay, but not great",6/10,3 December 2014,"I found this movie slow and tedious in the first 20 minutes or so and at times during the rest of the movie. I also thought the last quarter or so of the film was bizarre. As for the soundtrack, nothing special. I did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. On the other hand, I also had the feeling that I was watching an updated version of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the Stargate in 2001. Also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk, and a few other minor similarities. All in all, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great, and probably will not watch it again unlike some other sci-fi movies including the aforementioned ""2001, A Space Odyssey"".

952,ylshu-06641,Interstellar,9/10,16 May 2020,"On the one hand, space adventure, on the other hand, is a popular emotional drama. No matter how hard science fiction looks: wormholes, black holes, space adventures, multidimensional space The core is still family and love. In fact, science and theory serve for emotion, and wrap the softest emotion in a very hard shell. Because of this, it will not be as serious and great as 2001 science fiction, but it has a fuller feeling.

954,NotTheOne000,A fairy-tale from the future,10/10,26 August 2015,"Spoilers, of a sort, beneath the line.---Arthur C Clarke once wrote that any technology, sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from magic. Take this to its logical conclusion, and any sci-fi film with sufficiently advanced scientific concepts is indistinguishable from a fairy tale. That's what this film is. Do not challenge the science. Do not question the logic. Instead, seek to understand and appreciate the deeper meaning. The narrative is a framework for ideas about love. It's not sci-fi of galactic travel and relativity, it's sci-fi of the human soul.The Nolan brothers' message is a simple one. The love that ties us together exists in a very real, very objective sense. The limited forms by which we express love are the Morse code through which we communicate information held within our deeper personal realities. Our emotions are an unconscious realm beyond the Event Horizon, a place we cannot see into, consciously, from outside but which we can experience if we are not afraid of entering that part of ourselves without fear of what will happen to us. Love is an emotion that allows our inner selves to travel across galaxies and both backwards and forwards in time, not in a metaphorical sense, but in a literal sense. Each one of our personal existenceses is as much a construct as any other: observing reality is what makes reality real for us. We experience emotional reality and so that reality also exists within our personal universe. And our emotions are not things of the here and now. They exceed the limitations of the simple physical dimensions. Two objects cannot communicate across the Universe, but love links people together no matter how far apart they are. Emotions do not obey the rules they evolved to serve and utilitarianism is a period of human evolution we have outgrown. Rather our feelings inspire us, not just to survive and protect those we love, but to define what it means to survive and what it means to protect those we love. Emotion is the fifth dimension to our human reality.This is the most profound film of our generation.",Interstellar
955,thomas-fackler,2001: A Space Odyssey for the Modern Individual,4/10,27 November 2014,"I liked it. It was fairly smooth and put me through enough mental gymnastics that two days later I am still in recovery. It was a nice remake of the Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and keyed in on some of the problems homo sapiens sapiens could potentially face in this ever- changing world and universe.I really like the human feel: the idea that love, as a physical trait, might manifest itself across space-time is a fun philosophical speculative fiction.The use of theoretical physical models - anything can be done with mathematics and some computational power - adds an element of believability to the physical structure of the show.I am leaving off the three stars because Interstellar has some 'splainin' to do: ---plausibility is inconsistent. We can deal with the biological necessity of food in space, but can't deal with it on the easiest place for us to live in space? Maybe they should have hired a biologist and/or a chemist as well as a physicist for consulting purposes.---time is inconsistent. Yep, relativity. The Gargantua scene is done magnificently and really gives a great visualization of Einstein's theories as they relate to us as people. Again, when Cooper sees his daughter on her death-bed. However, Cooper fell into Gargantua. If one hour was the equivalent of ten years in the orbit he and Brandt were in on tidal wave planet then Cooper's clock must have been running ever slower relative to Earth's clocks as he fell towards the gravitational center of Gargantua.---what happened to all of the non-white folks on Earth. Were they eaten? Did they succumb to the blight? Just what is up with that? Maybe this should be under plausibility? This is probably just a United State problem.---making the sound-track louder and making things shake a bunch shouldn't be used to cover excursions into the fiction part of sci-fi. I am sure it is hard to move between the factual and the speculative, but a smoother transition would be much appreciated. I don't need the director to scream at me ""Suspend...belief...NOW!""",Interstellar
956,alfa-624-376688,Miserable inter human nonsense,1/10,30 November 2014,"Interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage (2014) as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space.It let me so down! Instead of a true vision for the future Interstellar works out an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship. Sorry Christopher Nolan but this is not what I payed for! Why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? The unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless. Austronauts don't go into space without a strict course. So not in Interstellar, in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take. This is supposed to be science? Don't make laugh! What a drivel!

958,fuller_ryan-48883,NASA said this is the most realistic deep space travel movie.,10/10,9 March 2019,"Interstellar is one of those movies you can watch over and over and still get a new appreciation for the film. I love Nolan's films. He is arguably my favorite film writer and director. Even though this is a science fiction movie, it feels very real. Nolan has such a talent for making his films seem real. Deep space Exploration is just around the corner in real life, but Nolan gives us the most realistic look at it in this film. As always, Nolan does an amazing job at putting together a terrific cast, special effects and takes you on the most incredible adventure that is out of this world. Interstellar is one film you have to see, even if you are not a big science fiction fan. The ending is worth the watch.

Its plot is up there with ""armaggeddon"" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of ""2001"" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing.",Interstellar

963,theneilrules,Sci-Fi Redefined,10/10,11 November 2014,"No wonder, Nolan did it again. Now this time he recurred with a movie which would be remembered as the greatest Sci-Fi movie ever made. It just seems that the person can apparently do no wrong. The movie is a visual masterstroke, a product of extensive research and co-relation among unexplored cosmic forces in a persuasive manner. The direction, visual effects and the storyline are sublime. Although, the plot didn't give the actors an optimum landmark for exhibiting their acting skills, the entire crew gave a commendable performance. Basically, understanding the true connotation this film conveys would require grasping the minute details Nolan has embedded in between the ongoing plot. But no matter how much we want to understand the movie, we'd still be lost in Nolan's idea of the vastness, uniqueness and true extent of our universe.An irrefutable 10 out of 10. You haven't witnessed anything like this.Sincere honors to one of the greatest directors of all time Sir Christoph Nolan. What a feat you've achieved! Keep up the excellent work.

964,billking6666,Bad science,8/10,2 April 2015,"The story was heartwarming and that part was okay, but the science was ridiculous. The idea of using a wormhole to enter another universe was fine, but they played fast and furious with the science after that. Entering a black hole is very possible, if you get close enough, but the only thing inside is highly compressed matter. The time dilation was interesting, until they mentioned 1 hour on a planet would equal 7 years. Time dilation requires TRAVELING (close to the speed of light). They made it seem like stopping on the planet would somehow accelerate the process. Then they manage to enter a black hole, without getting squashed like every other particle of matter and find an alien window to the past that goes to the man's daughter's room, so he can send information that will show him how to get there and then save the world. He earlier told his daughter that you ""cannot go back in time"", which is true. Then the movie contradicts him and the laws of physics in every way possible. I find it troubling that this was so highly rated. I suppose if you don't consider the science, it is a great watch.",Interstellar
965,iamchrisallan,If time travel were possible I would go back and not watch this film,3/10,16 November 2014,"I came out of the film thinking it wasn't bad but it just wasn't good either. After 24 hours of mulling it over it's dropped further in my estimation. Initially I just thought that if he had presented the same stuff in 1hr 49mins instead of 2hrs 49mins it would have been good but having had time to reflect, even that would not save it.I know that there is no sound in space but those moments of silence were really odd especially during explosions. It dulled all the excitement. The film was hugely lacking in suspense or tension.There are so many things wrong with the film and they are all topped off with the cheese-ball ending.Spoilers! Here are some of the irksome plot holes. Her dad is the ""ghost"" in the bookshelf who leaves her a message. The message that he doesn't leave is ""It's me, your Dad""If our future selves can transport Cooper through time and space why not put him in the bedroom and not in the book case. Why leave a message in binary or morse, why not just write it in the dust with the gravity?Why did Cooper take notice of the co-ordinates but not the message that said ""Stay""?Matt Damon was trying to describe how desperate he was to see fellow humans but no one gave a thought for the astronaut still on the main ship for 23 years.If you had secretly built a rocket that was mankind's last hope why would you ask a farmer, an ex-pilot to fly it at a few days notice?What the hell was Michael Caine rambling about in his death scene? What was he lying about and why the hell didn't our future selves communicate with him instead of a teenage girl?Blackboard mathematics? Really? Do mathematicians still write on blackboards? I suspect they have something slightly more sophisticated. I have seen the Big Bang Theory and even Sheldon Cooper uses a whiteboard and dry wipe pens.When Cooper disengages his craft and falls into the black hole so Brand can follow her heart it was so reminiscent of Bruce Willis staying behind in Armageddon that I wanted to barf. Not really a plot whole, just a reminder of more space hero cheese.The biggest goof of all for me was the ending. His aged daughter tells him to go after Brand. Now, hang on a minute, didn't he set Brand on her way to find her lover Edmund? Did I miss something? Did people find out that Edmund was a gonner? I don't think so. That means Cooper is potentially on his way to be the biggest gooseberry in history (or in the future) ever? Imagine that, Brand and her lover Edmund all set to be the new Adam and Eve when Cooper flies in all ready to procreate. I must have missed a key plot point. Had they fallen in love on the mission but there hadn't been time to cover it in 2hrs 49 mins? My final comment: I liked the robots.",Interstellar
966,kshehzad,Interstellar Will Give You 15 Minutes of Speechless Moment When It Ends,8/10,16 October 2017,"Recently highly anticipated Pakistani movie ""021"" starring Shaan Shahid received Boos and Hoots in Capri Cinema in Karachi. 021 which was being tipped as brainiest Pakistani movie ever by critics has not been well received by audience of single screen cinemas. Negative response from such an audience must not be assumed as final verdict because there is large section of society which praised this movie overwhelmingly and critics loved it. Same goes with Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"".Mr. Nolan's space adventure will confront same fate if it is released on same single screen cinema in Karachi. We will not be entirely wrong if we claim that Interstellar is for Nerds but not for Jerks. Since Mr. Nolan's romance with Batman franchise has ended he has been creating plots which have been difficult to decipher. First Inception and now with Interstellar Mr. Nolan has proved himself as a director who always intends to tingle with audience intelligence and consciousness through his unique ideas and does not have slightest fear of negative response from audience.Interstellar starts with a future world facing increasing level of nitrogen in earthly atmosphere and depleting level of oxygen causing catastrophic outcome. Crops have died and farmers are not able to produce anything except corn. Fertile grounds are converting into desert and massive sand storms have become daily routine. There are no armies in the world and US Government has shut down all unproductive endeavors such as NASA to save scarcely available resources. In this grim time NASA drop out engineer and currently corn farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds unknown gravitational anomaly which leads him to discover NASA working underground for years to save last of humanity.NASA's chief Professor Brand (Michael Caine) along with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) reveals him that NASA has discovered some sort of Traversable wormhole in our solar system near planet Saturn. Professor Brand convinces Cooper to lead a team of explorers to surpass the limitation on human space travel to discover inhabitable planet in other galaxy for humanity by using interstellar voyage through newly discovered wormhole. Cinematic presentation of concept of intergalactic traveling is not new for moviegoers but Interstellar gives us a slight nose dip with touch of reality. Interstellar looks like that Mr. Nolan has wrapped Paul Anderson's 1997 ""Even Horizon"" into Stanley Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey"" but with lots of emotions involved in. In one of scenes in which one of Interstellar voyager explains how Traversable wormhole works has an enormous similarity to one scene of ""Event Horizon"".As we know that Mr. Nolan is master of creating climax in almost every scene, Interstellar gives its viewers brainstorming sessions from beginning to end. As I have mentioned above this new Nolan's saga is a treat for Nerds and if you are not aware of the concepts such as Murphy's Law, Theory of Relativity, Traversable Wormhole, Black Hole and singularity then Interstellar is nothing but waste of 169 minutes of your life. Interstellar invokes many questions with subjective layering such as assuming love as the fifth dimension of the time and interstellar voyagers are shown discussing about ""They"" who presumably put this Wormhole up there in our solar system. This is the cleverness of Mr. Nolan who pops up many questions and expects viewers will draw conclusion according to their own set of beliefs. If you are Muslim believing in ascendancy of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) to heaven on the eve of ""Isra and Mi'Raj"" then Interstellar will strengthen your belief in it. If you are just a Nerd and love Einstein's Theory of Relativity then Interstellar is a roller- coaster ride for you with an unexpectedly happy ending. If you are father then you will shed tears with believe that father's love for his daughter can transcend everything in the universe. Whatever reason you can carry to watch Christopher Nolan's space outing but one thing is certain it will give you 15 minutes of speechless moment when it ends.",Interstellar

The movie itself is quite good with well chosen actors. I personally think Mackenzie Foy is brilliant. Especially for someone of her age.

968,Searsino,When Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Come Together,9/10,28 February 2021,"I'll spare the usual details given that 4000 others have covered the story of Interstellar. Rather, I'd like to say that once again I am truly baffled. Baffled at how every film the Nolan boys come together to write and direct, using the genius of Hans Zimmer to score their work, manages to evoke such emotion and captivate me to the very end.Despite the bitterness I have after seeing what Hans would do to the Lion King in Disney's live-action remake, I simply cannot ignore how unbelievably adept he is at his job.I decided to revisit this film after several years and found myself in tears by the end when Cooper and Murph finally reunite. And while the story itself surely had much to do with my reaction, I cannot ignore the role Hans' compositions played from opening credits on to the very end. I felt that final moment in my chest, as the two of them spent only a minute to acknowledge the journey both had taken.Am going to go out on a limb here and say that without this specific composer the film would have been very, very different. And Nolan seems to know just this. The partnership seemingly continues to sharpen their skills with each production. It's something I am in awe of as I watch the likes of Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk.An amazing sci-fi film with an original story to tell (rare nowadays) which you surely don't want to miss out on. This is one of those titles that I would put in the ""Must Watch"" pile as mandatory for everyone.",Interstellar

It had a daughter/father thing going on, which most of you wouldn't know about that type of situation. I wasn't merely having tears, I actually started bawling for at least 3 points in the story. It had a good time paradox thingy going on as well. Powerful story concept if you have an open mind to the possibilities of our actual existence in this universe. Great acting in all characters. Kudos to Matthew David McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. The other actors also did a great job.OIf course, there is also the moral dilemma of what to do when trying to save the Earth and, more personally, we humans. The only issue I have is... Who are ""they""? No depth at all into that. I think we are supposed to create our own ""they"" this story. Either one we pick, the story of this movie fits.One of the few movies that has actual meaningful depth in its overall story.",Interstellar
970,mrstrangerjones,Nolan's Space Drama is Kind Of A Mixed Bag,7/10,31 May 2018,"If I reviewed this film back in 2014, I would have probably given it a 9/10. However, now I've started to question some of the things about the film that just didn't really work for me.Christopher Nolan is considered one of the best directors working today, and I can attest to that. He reinvented Batman for the modern audience with ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" (after those crappy Joel Schumacher movies), and is even more famous for the thrillers ""Memento"" and ""Inception"". Nolan is a director known for making most of his movies think-pieces. With the exception of ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"", his movies aren't straightforward, especially not ""Memento"". In fact, they are quite complex. ""Interstellar"" tries to be, but sometimes, it just feels silly.PROS:
As usual, Christopher Nolan knows how to make a well made movie. While most directors tend to use computer generated visuals whenever they get the chance, Nolan tries to go for using practical effects as often as he can. And even when he does use CG, it doesn't look distractingly fake.The cast in this film was great. Matthew McConaughey, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and even child actor Mackenzie Foy were all great in their roles. There were some good performances from other actors (Timothee Chalamet, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck), but their roles were quite insignificant.-A large majority of the movie (specifically the first 2 hours 15 minutes) were absolutely great. It really worked as a dramatic sci-fi epic. I feel that if the movie was half an hour shorter, I would have given this movie a 9 (or maybe even a 10) out of 10.
Parts of the last half an hour (specifically the more heavily scientific elements) were done well. The first three times I watched ""Interstellar"", this part completely lost me. However, after watching a brief explanation by Neil DeGrasse Tyson (I was THAT desperate to understand this movie), it made a lot of sense.A large part of this movie is McConaughey's relationship with his characters daughter, played by Mackenzie Foy (as a child), Jessica Chastain (as an adult), and Ellen Burstyn (in her final minutes before she dies). The performances of McCounaghey and Foy really made their relationship feel real, and this even brought some scenes of emotion. I'm specifically referring to two scenes.The first is when McConaughey tells Foy that he has to leave, but also that he doesn't know when he's coming back. He even states that she may be as old as he is at this moment by the time he comes back (that's kind of a harsh thing to say to your daughter). Their acting really evoked a lot of emotion as it was evident that he didn't want to leave, but did so to be able to save her.
The second is a scene where he is watching video messages in his ship that were sent from his family. After an incident on a planet with harshly different relativity than Earth, McConaughey discovers that 27 years had passed on Earth. He watches messages on the ship and essentially watches his children grow up on a TV screen. The whole scene, McConaughey is weeping as he discovers these important events and regrets that he wasn't there to witness them.
I absolutely loved Hans Zimmer's score. It was absolutely spectacular. Some have joked that this film's score sounded like Hans Zimmer fell asleep on his organ, but I still felt that it was a mesmerizing soundtrack to a very interesting science fiction film.CONS (spoilers):
The film's last moments didn't work for me. They felt really cheesy. The main plot of the film involves trying to find habitable planets to move humans to. Hathaway wants to go to a certain planet, but partly because her boyfriend is researching it. In this scene, she says that love is the only thing that can go throughout space. To be honest, this felt like a slightly touching scene.Then I realized that this seemingly insignificant line was actually a big plot point. I won't go too deep into this, but I didn't really appreciate that.
Finally, I felt that the film dragged on in the final moments. Granted, one could say the same about ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (which I gave a 10 out of 10), but all of those moments actually felt necessary; also that was an adaptation of a book, while ""Interstellar"" was an original idea.Overall, I do recommend this film. But this is NOT Christopher Nolan's magnum opus that I originally viewed this film as.",Interstellar
971,spocktom,Mixed feelings,7/10,22 January 2015,"There's a lot to like in this film. The way it uses real and theoretical science, the way it doesn't pander to the Star Wars fans by showing space as it is, a soundless void. There's a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. Ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. Let me list them: 1/ The idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me.2/ Matthew McConaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. He seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying.3/ I don't think the US would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt Russia. Political correctness, I suppose, will probably become more intrusive in the future...but THAT intrusive? 4/ The ""incident"" with Matt Damon (""Dr. Mann"") is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film.5/ The robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. Even the B9 robot from the old TV show ""Lost in Space"" would have worked better.6/ Will Hollywood PLEASE pension off Mr. Zimmer and his theme-less exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. Much of the ""music"" was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. Goldsmith would be turning in his grave! I congratulate the Nolans for trying to make an intelligent SciFi film in these times of dross. They have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is.",Interstellar

But there are 2001 pearl jade in front of it, I think this one is at best in line with it. Nolan did what he could to make science fiction accessible. Hard core is full of human nature, warmth and dark side, making people cry.

976,Snowgoat,Something epic this way comes... but fails to arrive.,8/10,12 November 2014,"I managed to catch the 70mm IMAX version of this yesterday. I went not expecting much, since I really didn't like Inception, and although I felt that TDKR had some good moments it mainly served to highlight that when directors are given a free-reign by studios it typically only enables them to slide into self/over-indulgence and start repeating bad tricks and habits ad nauseam. Although I really liked Nolan's first few films, it now just feels like I pretty much know exactly what Nolan is going to serve up and how he's going to serve it. There will be much portent, followed by tonnes of exposition delivered-very-quickly-to-cover-the-fact-it- doesn't-really-hold-up-to-scrutiny People will soliloquize Scenes will be rapidly edited to the point where the geography of locations becomes impossible to decipher Cross-cutting will increase in regularity to the point of bewilderment New concepts and mini- plots will continue to be introduced on top of each other until we build up to some kind of big reveal, which will feel a bit forced and not that interesting. And if you didn't catch any of this, Hans Zimmer will be there hammering out another sonic masterpiece which will be mixed WAY TOO LOUDLY into the soundtrack to basically do Nolan's job for him. Finally, the whole film will be tied up neatly with a montage.And so it was little surprise to find all these things present in Interstellar – which I actually enjoyed a bit more than I was expecting. Perhaps the lowing of expectations helped, but despite the presence of all the expected Nolanisms Interstellar somehow held my attention better than Inception or TDKR did – though it was probably the subject matter more than anything. If like me, you're a big sci- fi fan, then a film like this is always going to hold your attention – since no matter how bad it may turn out to be, you're willing to hold out for some new image or concept you haven't seen before. Sadly Interstellar is a little short on originality. It feels cobbled together from about twenty better sci-fi movies and doesn't really have much of an identity of its own. And while I remained interested for most of the film, by the time the big reveal came, it was so obvious, underwhelming and frankly nonsensical that it left me with a very deflated feeling as the credits rolled. Without revealing too much, anyone with any sci-fi leanings is bound to guess the twist in the opening scene – literally. I hoped and prayed it was going to turn out to be more interesting than I feared but it wasn't. There were a few very nice images in the film – the journey through the wormhole probably the best of them and represented something new (though it was unfortunately very short lived!). The other two major visual cues were effectively rehashes of things Nolan used in Inception, and on the whole I was underwhelmed with the space footage. The exterior shots of the various spaceships are usually dull, repetitive and often look surprisingly shabby. This is not an effects extravaganza. The robots were nicely designed and realised, however. The acting was pretty strong, and despite McConaughey's mumbling (which is becoming very grating) he never outright annoyed me. Sadly, the actors were in many cases given characters whose motivations and actions were nonsensical (a lot like Prometheus!), meaning the actors are left shouldering blame for bad writing. The anger and resentment Murph has towards her father makes very little sense once she's grown up, and the whole subplot involving Dr Mann was an absolute mess (and not the fault of the actor!). The general planning and plotting of the NASA team was also poorly explained and ridiculously convoluted. All the various missions seemed contrived to fit in with the path for the script rather than coming out of any logical reasoning.Hans Zimmer's music was great. I'm a huge Zimmer fan, and it was nice to see him depart from his comfort zone for this. Unfortunately, as is now usual for a Nolan film, it was mixed in the soundtrack far too loudly and I feel Zimmer will catch a lot of flack for bad sound mixing which isn't his fault. Unfortunately, as with Nolan's last few films Zimmer's music just felt bigger, stronger and more imaginative than the film itself. A lot of people have been comparing Interstellar to Contact, but having re-watched the latter recently it's no real comparison – Contact is a much better film. Signs? Sure, there are some comparisons, but despite Signs failings and contrivances, it still felt fresher and more interesting than this. 2001? Come on!!! Quite honestly, I'd say Interstellar probably has most in common with Mission to Mars as far as quality and content goes. I imagine those who are ranting about Interstellar being some kind of masterpiece are either people who've never seen a sci-fi film in their lives, or young male Nolan obsessives blinded by devotion to a director who's become increasingly predictable and irritating. That said, it's far from the worst film in the world and worth a look for sci-fi fans. But I very much doubt it will change your life, and I'm not sure I'd bother busting a nut to get to a 70mm IMAX unless it's convenient (I found watching an digital 3D IMAX presentation of Gravity a far more visually stimulating experience).",Interstellar
977,bryno92,Highly Overrated,7/10,3 November 2015,"Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie.",Interstellar
978,nimstic,Truly one of the best movies ever made.,9/10,3 April 2015,"There's something unique about movies that get high ratings on IMDb but disproportionately lower % on RT - love. A beautiful piece of work by Nolan, this film takes on a different dimension of film making - literally. As a revolutionary film maker, he explores path breaking concepts boldly. Even if you are not a science geek you will easily 'get' and enjoy the language used for story telling through the universe. The mesmerising play across the realm of time, space and gravity while running a flawless story for 3 hours to perfect closure.While watching I felt like I had been on a journey too through the dimension of time. I had never bent my mind so much so comfortably while watching any movie. Hans Zimmer's music is soul-stealingly haunting. Mcconaughey, Chastain and Hathway put up spectacular performances. Love it.

979,DennisLaursen89,A lot of unexplained things,7/10,8 November 2014,"***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS***Christopher Nolan - the man behind one of the greatest sci-fi movies IMO, Inception - wrote this movie.I really like this movie, and the 3 hours went very fast. However, the movie leaves me with some frustrations on some plot holes and unexplained things. On the big water planet our crew went to, it is explained, that the gravity is so powerful, that an hour on that planet is about 7 Earth-years. With so heavy a gravity, the crew should be crushed by the gravity. However, the planets gravity is only 1.4 of the Earths gravity. And furthermore, when the crew return to the base after 15 minutes, the remaining crew-member have waiting 26 years. And how can the main person enter a black hole(!) without being crushed or anything?If this nonsense not where present in the movie, it would easily get 9 or 10 stars from me.",Interstellar
980,film316-125-427677,"Not A God Awful, small affair.",10/10,30 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan. My how you've grown, from the tiny hatching's of thrillers like Insomnia, to the forever puzzling Inception, and no one could dare to forget The Dark Knight trilogy. You sir are a man who has redefined cinema in so many different ways you have transformed the way we look at our dreams and our comic book heroes, so it was truly only a matter of time before you stopped looking down and into people and started to look up to the sky and say to yourself ""what if?"" this is where Interstellar comes in. Normally I would make some kind of pun at this point, but this film deserves more respect than that.When I first heard about Interstellar it was 2 years ago and someone said to me ""It's Christopher Nolan playing around with parallel dimensions"" I knew I would love it instantly. I knew that this was a film that couldn't fail, how could it? I know many people thought this might be a film that was just ""too clever for it's own good"" but this is the same man who created Inception, which is still for me the benchmark of films forever.Interstellar has a totally different tone to all of Nolan's other works, in Interstellar he has taken a concept and applied his imagination and thinking to it, and that concept is ""what if the world started to die on us"". It's a question that has been asked many times before, in any apocalypse film you care to name (The Road springs instantly to mind), but in Nolan's mind it's fresh and new again, because even in the very end of the world Christopher Nolan still believes there would be hope that we could survive past our own lives and existence. In fact that is what the very word Interstellar means. Interstellar shows something different from Nolan's other works and that is the evolution of an idea, you can see the concept of Interstellar take shape and grow in front of you, as if you yourself are creating the movie you are watching, because it's all so logical that the entire film makes sense from one step to the next. Nolan covers every single question or wish list that you would have in Interstellar, if you watch the trailer and find yourself thinking ""That looks incredible, I really hope this happens.... "" the chances are that in Interstellar it happens. That's not to say this movie feels like fan service, because Nolan still strongly keeps his identity during the film; his trademark shots and moments he has become known for are written all over it.I feel I'm stating the obvious here, but the film is just about the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in cinema. As always there are so many moments to enjoy which are stand alone and also the film as a whole, both make you at times cry with the shear magnitude of what you are watching.Interstellar also has some truly heavy themes and also some heart rending scenes. Also it's so pleasing to see that Hanz Zimmer has finally found something else to use apart from the ticking of a watch, in this instance it's a grand organ, which only adds to the feeling of grandeur that the films vibrates.Like all of Nolan's work, Interstellar draws you in, slowly at first and then quickly, drawing to it's conclusion with a grace and confidence rarely seen in cinema, Nolan rushes for no one, he lets each scenario and point take hold of us and rest on our shoulders before moving on, there are several scenes at the beginning of the film which continually reinstate each other, but they never get repetitive.One thing I will say about Interstellar is that it doesn't have the riddle of Inception, it's not compulsive to watch it again, but you want too. That's not to say the film isn't complicated, it is very in depth and at times a challenge to understand, however by the end everything comes perfectly together to fit into place and make one of the greatest movies ever seen.The cast are something to behold, there are a number of surprises in Interstellar for people (Much like David Bowie in The Prestige), but for the majority of the movie this is Matthew McConaughey show. When it was announced I'll admit I was somewhat confused as to why Nolan has picked him, but as the movie progresses it becomes obvious and MaConeys natural talent shines through.Interstellar is everything we hoped it was going to be, redefining the sci-fi genre and pushing at the boundaries of what we understand, Nolan is a pioneer of the mind. The moment the credits roll for Interstellar there is only one thing you want to do, watch it all again.",Interstellar
981,maryolalov,A science fiction movie that is definitely worth watching,9/10,17 February 2017,"A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching.",Interstellar

It just jars for me against the rest of the film. It's by no means poorly acted or badly shot, I just find that sequence out of sorts with the rest of the movie.

983,bobtheplanet,Inter... STELLA!,3/10,17 August 2015,"I only give this movie 3 stars because, like many others, I believe it will balance out the mindlessly effusive reviews that IMDb seems to generate for highly-anticipated movies. I must say, however, that I would honestly give this movie about a 5 or 6 and no more. The main problem I see with it is typical of many modern movies - poor screen writing. Doesn't anyone read this stuff between the final draft and filming? At 2 hours and 45 minutes I did not think it was overlong. I wasn't bored so much as flummoxed. I actually believe there is a magical extra 15 minutes somewhere that might steer this titanic disaster away from the critical icebergs that may doom it.Down to particulars:Too Much Damn Corn! (In more ways than one)The future in this movie actually does not look too bad. There's plenty of beer, pickup trucks, and no okra (yay!). So what is the beef? There really is no convincing reason to leave Earth because of some piffle about environment degradation. The effort involved to create artificial environments in space would seem to me to be exponentially more time consuming and expensive than the same effort on good old terra firma. The whole ecosystem collapse story is unnecessary. Why have we gone into, and continue to go into, Outer Space even though wars, famine, and pestilence beset us continually? Nolan should have bit the bullet and gone for the real answer instead of making up a fairy tale - that is, our innate curiosity and desire for knowledge will drive us to the limits of the Universe and beyond. We don't need hokey dust storms and blights (Say, how did those spacelings solve the food blight problem in their massive cylinders - and why position them out by Saturn? Why didn't they just go underground instead of into space? ) And the seriousness of the situation on Earth just wasn't conveyed well except during the massive dust storm. Another odd thing never explained - no dogs, no cats, no chickens, pigs, or cows... not even a crow or a rat to be seen. Where are the animals? Where are the insects? Some of the 15 min. could have been used to clarify these points, but better yet... chuck the whole first hour.Too Much Damn Noise!Some people may like Hans Zimmer's work, but I don't see him as the next Jerry Goldsmith or Bernard Herrmann. It was like listening to Philip Glass at 110 db and certainly did not sound as spacey as Vangelis' work for Blade Runner. Especially annoying when it covered up important dialog in the dramatic moments, but that may be due to sound mixing. Overall, I rate him as flat and innocuous at best. And speaking of dialog, was MC channeling Marlon Brando for his role? Some of his dialog was barely comprehensible. For a movie heavy with exposition that is a bit unacceptable.Too Many Damn Holes!Speaking of exposition: how the hell did MC learn to fly those new-fangled space machines so fast (everyone else had simulator classes); How did they get all that junk into space to build their starship with no one on Earth noticing dozens of Saturn V rockets blasting into the sky? Why didn't MC just say ""Murph"" instead of ""Stay"", he already knew he would leave, because HE ALREADY KNEW HE WOULD LEAVE GRAVITY TRACES TO COMMUNICATE AND SOLVE THE EQUATION! When they surfed down the wave why didn't the ship crash into the surface of Miller since it was only covered with 12 inches of water most of the time? They never did get it straight about the 5-D beings - are they us, or something else? Why? Why? Why? Too many unanswered questions glossed over amid all the physics mumbo-jumbo in this convoluted mess.I'm sorry, it was a dud, nothing stellar about it.",Interstellar

986,warrenf_peace,"As Seminal as 2001, with near perfect execution, Nolan creates another Masterpiece that brings the audience on a journey to themselves. *SPOILER*",9/10,6 November 2014,"I cannot give Nolan's SciFi epic ""Interstellar"" a 10, because he got a little loose in places (especially towards the end, where he could have tied up just a few niggling bits), that being said, he gets closer to the perfect Kubrick ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" than anyone ever has before, and can now raise his glass as having cemented himself as the true Master auteur we all knew him to be.Nolan was in inspired form, getting phenomenal performances from everyone; there was not a weak link in the bunch (and I'm not a big Topher Grace fan - even He turned in an excellent performance). And I was kind of expecting Matt Damon to overplay his role, but he was reeled in just right for the picture, and I think he added a nice little dark aside- hooray for him. The sets were literally out of this world while being in it; the tech was really solid (my dad worked on Apollo, and I KNOW...)I enjoyed the robot(s) - just enough cheese, without being too much. The space ships Nolan got right (especially the interiors, and all the important stuff like gravity and propulsion). Most importantly, he got his astrophysics and relativity right (FINALLY! Someone Gets it Right!! Yippee!). The cryo sleep chambers, while not the same future as the Nostromo, was serviceable. I could go on, but it's late. The main genius of ""Interstellar"" is the script, (and a certain segment near the end, that might get you to sing ""When the moon is in the seventh house..""). Nolan wrote a great script, and executed it beautifully. His actors should all be up for awards (as well as direction, visual effects, and ESPECIALLY the Music!!!) The haunting underscore set the mood and added an extra dimension. Mr. Nolan, Thank You for a really fulfilling film! I want a sequel!!",Interstellar

988,ace_nair,"Beautiful and breathtaking, but what is the point being made?",8/10,23 November 2014,"The movie takes place sometime in the not so distant future. Crops have been ruined by blight and the focus of the world has moved from technology to agriculture to ensure that the supply can meet the demand for food. In short, Earth is dying and killing mankind in the process. Former NASA pilot Cooper (McConaughey) is now a farmer living with his teen son, ten-year old daughter Murphy and father. Murphy discovers some strange happenings in her rooms with things being knocked off her shelves and Cooper discovers this to be a message which points him to the underground version of NASA. Cooper enrolls for a mission with 3 other scientist and 2 robots to travel through a worm hole to discover hospitable planets.The first act of the story concentrates on the father-daughter dynamics (Mackenzie Fay does a great job as the young Murphy) and the second and third act of the story deals with interstellar travel and the possible discovery of other humans who were sent by NASA to search for the hospitable planets and how Cooper manages to fight time, space and gravity to get back to his family billions of miles away. I was unaware that Matt Damon was in the movie, so that was a nice surprise when he appeared and after ten minutes I badly wanted him to disappear.The movie runs for over 160 minutes, not that you notice. The special effects are amazing and the worm hole, new planets and the space travel have been created very intricately. Nolan has his signature sweeping camera shots and character build up to involve the audience with his story.I enjoyed the movie but a few things didn't work for me. The core of the movie was food being scarce but beer was plenty. The amount of dust/dirt that was flying around, there was no way to keep anything clean for a period of time – so certain things could have remained on Cooper's farm as it did towards the third act. And the final act has Cooper meeting with his progenies who show no interest in him whatsoever – I mean you would like to hold the hand of your grandfather even if you never met him right? Michael Caine ages beautifully in 23 years (he goes from ancient to more ancient and doesn't look a day older). I would like to share more peeves, but that would be giving away more of the plot. This is a good movie – one of those you absolutely have to watch on the big screen, but it will left me wondering at the end ""What was the point of it all?""",Interstellar
989,aimenoon,I have no words,10/10,25 September 2019,"I first saw Interstellar when i was 14. I did'nt have a clue what i was watching . Fast forward to 2018 I watched it and kinda liked it , yet i could only make up some of it . So , I started watching it again & again & again till I had no idea that I had already seen it 14 times consectively . It all makes sense now . This film is one of the most scientifically acurate
( tho science fiction ) and enough to bring a person to tears. I can't really put into words how much this movieeans to me.

990,ylshu,Interstellar,8/10,10 April 2020,"There is a belief called Nolan. If most good movies are still good-looking, Interstellar is great. Fortunately, there is a master named Nolan in our time. He showed us the future of the film industry. The narration of the film has transcended the real world. It is a perfect interleaved soundtrack, which makes my heart flutter and my eyes filled with tears.

Therefore, I save gigs by watching films through Redbox though after this horrid experience I might just buy another 30gb plan but I digress. That's how I happened on this supposedly high rated film. Tired of the mediocre crap that you normally get out of Redbox, I cross referenced IMDb in hopes of a better choice. Disappointment is an understatement. Somewhere around an hour, I realized the film would be nearly THREE HOURS LONG! So much unnecessary garbage effects, dialogue, etc. Christopher Nolan WHO CARES?I'm just thankful the trite, clichéd and extremely boring film is over. Thankful that I had it on DVD and could fast-forward through the epically duller parts save yourself the time wasted from your life, since I've already done it for you, forget about this film and move on to something better.

992,scottyxl,Almost perfect but +1 for being a realistic space exploration sci-fi,10/10,19 November 2014,"WOW, just WOW! This film was almost perfect!The story and plot where phenomenal and scientifically quite accurate, the shots where stunning (the shot of them passing by Saturn was absolutely breathtaking) and the acting was top-notch. The film really sucks you in, twists you around and then silences the room to only then explode in your face. Some people may not have liked the sound editing at some points but for me (with subtitles) the loud Noise at some points really emphasized the lack of sound in space in other parts and I thought this was genius. The ending was a bit far-fetched for me but it rounded up the film nicely and it did include a few (tiny) errors but then again I have yet to see a movie that has none.For some reason I did think there was something wrong, maybe the ending, so I couldn't give it a 10 right away. I am a true lover of space exploration films and movies that I'm giving it +1 rounding up to a 10/10. I'll be watching this at-least once more time (and possibly even more) in IMAX because the experience was just breathtaking",Interstellar
993,boy13,One of the worst movies,3/10,29 November 2014,"Interstellar is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. The damage is done in beginning as movie starts with a lack luster plot and keeps dragging without getting in the main story-line. Though acting is fairly good. It is lack of interesting dialogs which makes people loose the grip. I was waiting for something to happen in the movie. Good editing and cutting out unnecessary incidents would have made the movie much different. Though it is compared to Inception, it totally lacks the fun punch and originality of Inception. Also, it keeps the viewers hanging and too many questions unanswered. The movie tries to do exciting by showing time travel and worm holes in last one third of the movie. However, it couldn't save it.",Interstellar
994,majoreasy,Decent Visuals but very lazy story telling...,5/10,11 November 2014,"Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again.",Interstellar

996,davphv,Confusion spoils good space yarn,6/10,28 December 2015,"I watched this on DVD. The first half of the movie seemed like it needed an intro as to why the world was so devastated. Also why there were no threat of violence from gangs hoarding all the resources like most other apocalypse movies? Nice human touch, but not realistic. We don't know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. What happened to the weather patterns? Strike one. How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. Where did that multi-dimensional structure come from? Seemed like it came from 2001 Space Odessey. Strike three. The plot leaps from grounded science to Twilight Zone too often for me. Before the movie I was wanting to give it a high grade, but I don't think I'll even watch it again. Anne Hathaway bumps it up a notch.

997,dogonu-215-965738,Long laborious boring waste of time.,1/10,12 November 2014,"This movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it. First off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days, with what I assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was. When a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a Ken Burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way. We have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and I say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be, unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of Morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe. The second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon, space and beyond. Anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked. The last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when Mathew Mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bed,only to chase him out of the room. Then there are the million questions that don't add up, there is no army any more, LOL like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had. Mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie, where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn, and where did NASA come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no US government to build all this crap? Its a known fact that the scientists at NASA built not a darn thing nor ever have, its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them. NASA does not so much as put one bolt in one hole. Micheal Cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning. Damn that Geritol is working good. This movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like Contact. You will learn to swear after leaving if you don't know. It will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and don't care or understand content or plot, and by the hippie ECO nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers.

1000,gvf,In what universe is this a good movie??,2/10,10 May 2015,"Honestly, I have no idea why other people, and everybody really, has been giving this movie such high ratings and rave reviews. To me, the entire film is poorly thought out, contrived drivel.It starts with the beginning of the story, where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) more or less by accident tries to break and enter into government property by applying a bolt cutter to the gate of the secret government complex where the mission is being planned, and is subsequently enlisted as the mission head pilot, of all things. I don't care if we're told that he used to be an Air Force pilot and apparently a notable one at that with old acquaintances in high places; that was a big letdown in storytelling, erm, right out the gate for me. Just too lazy for a film of its (attempted) magnitude.With all the good reviews in mind, I thought I was at least going to be wowed by the rest of the film's plot and the imagery. Well, with the cheap availability (in film studio terms) of pretty much even the grandest CGI effects these days, there was nothing about the imagery that ""Elysium"", ""Oblivion"" and particularly ""Gravity"" haven't already done in recent times, and better, and the whole plot not only disappointed with half-hearted but self-indulgently attempted forays into philosophy and some semi-spooky abnormal phenomena, but also by its ignorance of some quite basic natural laws. While the idea of time dilation within the gravitational field of a black hole was actually somewhat well explained, you just scratch you head at 500-foot monster waves on the water planet which suddenly rush across a vast expanse of otherwise knee-deep water that looks about as agitated as a reflecting pool (think Tsunamis back here on Earth). Also, there is no such thing as a more gentle black hole which won't spaghettify you as you approach it and therefore kill you dead. The list of errors goes on far beyond this.And finally, the last 20 minutes or so sucked worse than the black hole whose (imagined) innermost we get to see. It felt like a bad rehash on acid of the scene in the first ""Matrix"" sequel where Neo meets the Architect. A culmination of all the things that make the plot of this movie so dreadfully banal.Again, like I said, I just can't understand why people would think that this is a good or even an outstanding movie. Yes, I know that this is a film which would like to get you to think more deeply about the issues it raises, and pick up on its whole philosophical angle. And I generally really like movies like that. But sorry, there are many films which have done a much better job at this, without falling flat on their face in the process.Long story short, after close to three hours, I felt about as robbed of my time as Cooper when he watched the video transmissions of his ageing kids from back on Earth.",Interstellar
1001,almanjit25,Interstellar: A New Hope,9/10,7 November 2014,"Words cannot describe the transcendent journey that is Christopher Nolan's undoubted masterpiece Interstellar. I will try my best but know that even these words do no justice to this colossus, this gargantuan epic, this feat of artistry, cinema and soul. Christopher Nolan is a genius and, unlike the others who he is compared to, his films lack pretension. Most of his films achieve some sort of sentience in terms of their depth, soul, emotion, artistry, intelligence, philosophy, psychology and most importantly humanity. Interstellar takes these qualities to a whole new plane, transcending dimensions above and beyond all his filmography to date. What is Interstellar? It is a love story, a story about and for humanity, a story of our faults and limitations, of our greatest strengths and what makes us human. It is a journey for survival, hope and faith. It is a celebration of life, family and the greatest bond of all, the parent-child bond. Interstellar is a universal celebration of the power of emotions and love. It is a tale of science and exploration, our ability to look beyond the ordinary and search for something greater, the infinite possibilities of our universe, our imagination and our ability to push boundaries. It highlights what we can achieve as a species. A love letter penned for humanity, Nolan shows his faith in the human race with this masterpiece. A journey through space and time, soul and heart, Interstellar is thought provoking, soul searching, ambitious and heroic. Intelligent and philosophical, it asks moral questions while painting an epic that traverses the space-time continuum. Conversely it questions our progress and the damage we have done to our home, Earth, painting a grim picture of humanity's future if we don't stop exploiting the Earth and her resources. We were given Earth as a home for reason and if we destroy it, we destroy ourselves, our history and future. It is as much a commentary on sustainability and nature's bounty and wrath as it is a story of hope, family and love. There is no place like home, like our Earth, so we must strive to not ruin the only home we know.Like all of Nolan's films, everyone will interpret it in their own way. Mesmerizing and haunting, a flawless amalgamation of humanity, soul, heart, faith, survival and science, Interstellar is a new hope. A cinematic colossus of innovation and a personal masterpiece penned by a visionary in addition to being an homage to space epics of old. Interstellar is inspiring and reaches deep into the furthest recesses of the mind and just leaves you moved, utterly floored and stimulated. Interstellar will change the way you gaze at the heavens above. The skill and workmanship that went into this film is awe-inspiring. The time, personal sacrifice and heart that made this film a masterpiece and triumph at every level is more that abundantly evident all through the picture. A pioneer of a new type of space film, one that as I earlier stated, transcends above all the rest and achieves unimaginable heights.Aside from the great screenplay and script, the acting is of the highest caliber. Matthew Mcconaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine and the rest of the stellar cast take this grand vision and scope to unfathomable heights with their prowess and depth. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting, dauntless and dramatic, forceful even in the greatest possible way. It was moving and wove itself effortlessly with Nolan's vision becoming the perfect accompaniment, second to none. The cinematography is breathtaking and mind altering, transporting. This is a film that made me laugh, cry and rejoice. A true masterpiece unlike anything you will ever see.",Interstellar
1002,the_only_warrior,"Good idea, Beautiful film, horrible script",6/10,8 November 2014,"Interstellar tells the story of the fight for the survival of Earth after a global catastrophe destroys almost all food sources for humans. While humans are trying to rebuild, it is clear that it is a losing battle. But NASA, which has gone underground, is meanwhile scouting other possible worlds to colonize before it's too late.The best points is that from a technical standpoint, it's an incredible movie. The space travel, the post-catastrophe planet Earth (all very difficult things to pull off) look so astounding believable you forget that there are any special effects in the movie. In an era with so much bad CGI even in big budget films, this is quite an achievement.Now the bad parts: most of the ""science"" in the film is pure fantasy - when they try to explain the harder parts of it, it is just illogical gobbledygook that you just have to swallow... they may as well not even have tried and gone for the full Matrix treatment.Although the story ideas are good, the characters are pretty shallow (you only learn the background of one character and it's not much) and all of them are way too selfish to sympathize with. They were not just flawed, but hateful. Christopher Nolan rightly believed that this was the most important element of the film and sadly it fell flat.The missing story of the characters also is there for the Earth. What happened? Where are all the animals? Is there more to Earth than that one town and farm we see over and over again.And yet the film is over three hours long.In the end, although I enjoyed the film in parts, it's not one I will watch over and over again. Definitely see it in the cinemas though if you get the chance!",Interstellar
1003,Gray_Balloon_Bob,"Not a masterpiece, but not so trite as some people would have you believe.",8/10,29 November 2014,"My opinions on Nolan's films need refreshing. Before I undertook this cosmic voyage the other night, I hadn't experienced any work of his since The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, which is in retrospect a turgid and self-important affair. I understand that many probably appreciate him for his abilities in forming a sort of marriage between grandiose and exhilarating blockbuster spectacle and quieter, experimental sensibilities, but in the vast library of cinema he hasn't really attracted me, and I make this point clear because perhaps in reviewing this film I lack the insight into his body of work to make interesting distinctions and fully appreciate what he is doing here. As it stands on its own terms it is a thoroughly engaging piece of cinema. And more.wholesome than Inception. We begin small in setting, big in thematic possibilities. The world is dying, and has regressed into a failing crop society, which our intrepid protagonist Coop (Matthew McConaughey) is a part of. He's the humble but ambitious mid-western Dad, living on a farm with his Nuclear family. This isn't anything we haven't seen before; they're a functioning unit held together by the love and will of Hero Dad, the every-man who although relatable and ostensibly normal, we know is going to be far more talented and auspicious than any of us could ever hope to be. Will he be the saviour of man-kind? Who knows? What's important is McConaughey is unsurprisingly excellent here, with all the rustic charm we could want. As derivative and by-the-numbers sentimental as this film gets, it's never tiresome, simply because it is done so well, as evinced in the first hour and the final minutes of the film, which are work despite their Hollywood convictions.It's quiet and familial at first, and there's a nice dawning sense of adventure contrasting with the eerie Dust Bowl wilderness that society is becoming, which is seemingly already post-apocalyptic, having settled into this new reality, where for example people's roles in society are determined for them based on their qualities, and so there a pre-established categories waiting to be filled, quite a dystopic idea. But this film isn't dystopian. It's too warm and optimistic, and for every portentous philosophical pondering that inhabits the script – ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"" – there's the saccharine elements, like the films (particularly in the form of the wizened contemplative Michael Caine) constant quoting of Dylan Thomas' 'Do not go Gentle into that good night' which becomes some sort of mantra for humanity's perseverance in the depths of universal darkness.When the film does begin its space-faring quest, it is a spectacle and an excitement that is unparalleled in current blockbusters. Seeing the detail of the ship against the vast background of space, peering through the windows at the distant earth, and eventually journeying into the wondrous unknown of new planets is something profound in itself, and perhaps Nolan should have taken a note from Kubrick and relied more on the power of these visuals to communicate ideas rather than resorting to platitudes and tiring exposition. There are of course going to be comparisons to 2001, but the similarities are only superficial and the tone of each film strikingly different. The film bears a little more resemblance to Close Encounters of a Third Kind, in that familial life is interrupted by cosmic events, particularly in the father who is torn between the domestic and the wider possibilities of existence. Even that is only a passing resemblance, and there are probably far more influences and connections I'm not aware of. Speaking of the expository, too much of it is used during moments on the ship when the characters could be developing and acting like people with the weight of humanity on their shoulders. Wes Bentley, an actor whom I love but have tragically seen very little of, is unfortunately an example of this, his character just a tool for the explanatory, and so is wasted. Anne Hathaway is Anne Hathaway the Astronaut, dressing up in all the gear and wearing a different name, yet still the same person. Although though mentioning only her would be far too selective, as almost every actor is just the recognizable face working within the confines of the script. A special mention should be given to Mackenzie Foy, Coop's 10 year old daughter who gives a poignant performance. So, this film isn't subtle, but it is an enthralling journey. There are smaller touches I appreciated, like the sound bridge of the T Minus Countdown linking the scenes of McConaughey reluctantly (McConaughey probably cries more than he does than in all his other films collectively, and boy is it an affecting sight) leaving his family behind and the ship taking off from Earth; the immediacy of this making his decision all the more emotional, but ultimately the film excels during its space exploration, a time when, like 2001, it is the definition of awesome.",Interstellar
1004,joeventuraa,Hated it but it was Good,2/10,14 November 2014,"This movie was so slow and jagged like Inception...I felt much the same in that movie. It started so slowly...boring even...I text a friend about it in the movie...then it ramped up but the edits bounced too much from space ship to earth. I felt the establishing plot was not developed and I felt lost and bored most of the movie. The end was twilight zone powerful, but not enough to save this movie.My dad is aging so the wheelchair scene was hard and MC in the hospital. Adding of all actors Matt Damon was so bad. Really, MD? It took me way out of the movie. Casey Affleck was OK for his role, but Damon was too much. Hire someone else! Both actors chinked up for the roles.The concept and production brilliant...i didn't like the movie but lie with Inception it was genius to conceive and produce. C- at best

1005,adamoctranspo,Is there a better Sci-fi flick?,10/10,4 November 2018,"Interstellar may be my favorite film. Certainly my favorite Sci-fi movie. It pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished on film. Christopher Nolan figured out how to tell a compelling story about characters we really care about. There is no wastee scene in this film, no pointless dialogue. The acting is amazing and Matthew McConaughey leads this film with a force. The soundtrack matches the intensity of the story. This is a must watch, full attention, no phone to distract you. It's rewarding though, the type of film that makes you think. I watch this once a year and I never get sick of it. These are the kind of blockbusters we need.

1006,antonydwhitehead,Stanley Kubrick can rest easy . . .,3/10,20 November 2014,"After a long drawn-out establishing sequence on our trashed home planet Cooper and young Murph (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy) follow a mysterious trail to a secret NASA lab where a last ditch mission to a wormhole to save humankind is revealed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) for which Cooper is implausibly selected to pilot.This section is reasonably authentic: conventional rocket stages and a shuttle-like capsule which then docks with a larger vessel capable of achieving artificial gravity through centrifugal force to take them on the two year mission to Saturn. But from then on the science and the script become increasingly fantastical; whether in the high energy environment near Saturn, or (later) falling into a black hole our plucky astronauts absolutely need not fear radiation. The formula for the rocket fuel must be worth a fortune: after the initial conventional launch the landing and taking off from large Earth sized planets is achieved miraculously with small shuttles, so why the staged launch vehicle was needed is a mystery. The initial two year trajectory from Earth to Saturn and the wormhole does not then restrict the spaceship suddenly changing course and having a quick fly round the wormhole: the laws of celestial mechanics initially adopted are suddenly thrown out the window! Communication (which is essential in the script to move the plot forward) is also maintained somehow through the wormhole and back to Earth. The three planets themselves fall into formulaic categories of water world, ice planet, and (at the end) desert planet, and whilst some have oxygen whether there are plants or living organisms producing the oxygen is not made clear. The sexy black hole Gargantua gets lots of attention, but the star(s) at the heart of the system are forgotten about.Despite data from earlier probes dispatched through the wormhole the astronauts seem to know next to nothing about the planetary conditions (again essential for the script) but somehow arrive exactly where the early expeditions landed (or crashed). It seems the script is as twisty as the wormhole! Throughout this movie there is absolutely no sense of any rudimentary astronomical comprehension and so despite the painfully thin gloss of authenticity we are basically in Star Trek space fantasy land: anyone seeing this movie expecting verisimilitude will feel they have been very cleverly conned.The derivative concept boils down to one part 2001 A Space Odyssey to one part Contact with a liberal dollop of Gravity (space docking / disasters etc). The art design is in itself curious: the clunky robots seem to be wilfully jointed variants of the monoliths from 2001, the cheap and nasty space suits (intentionally?) retro NASA, the hibernation pods that sink dramatically into the floor (why?) part 2001 part Alien. Overlaying the woefully dodgy science is a powered-up emotion plot line that at times is intensely annoying and hugely implausible: for example when one of the astronauts drowns on the water world all the attention is on Cooper missing his family; their dead colleague with whom they have been cooped up in the spaceship for years is immediately forgotten, and when they return to the mother ship the fact the remaining astronaut has been waiting for 20 years gets little plot attention: more wormholes in the aim-to-crowd-please script? This mid-film emphasis on Cooper and his family is massively self indulgent and McConaughey's character becomes very irritating. .Throughout Hans Zimmer's score provides a high decibel level of aural dampening to divert the brain from these trivial inconsistencies or when the plot or painful dialogue starts to sag; whilst Brand (Anne Hathaway) provides cute. Those parts of the script that are discernible through the thundering score are lightweight, tedious, and overworked.So what do we learn if we retrospectively compare the three movies: 2001, Contact, and Interstellar: in hindsight 2001 can now be seen to represent a triumph of direction and cinematography, thoughtful intelligent script, a sound science base bound together in beauty and imagination; in contrast Contact it seems is already exhibiting the growth of emo in science fiction movies (epitomised by the self indulgence offered its star Jodie Foster), though this is contained within a reasonably plausible and scientifically based script, but oh dear when we look at Interstellar doesn't this movie says something rather awful about the sloppy crowd pleasing filmic times we live in, with the massed forces of technical wizardry and editing coupled with that all pervasive score to dull our dissent. Stanley Kubrick can rest easy; despite the hype Interstellar is not going to knock 2001 of its stellar perch. Overblown, over-hyped, corny, unscientific, implausible, Interstellar fails majestically as great cinema. Meanwhile 2001 like the very best sci-fi is subversive, it has edge - even satire, it transcends genres, it asks us the audience to think, and it exposes the brutality of the human condition. Where it is optimistic this optimism is undercut ambiguously, and it has profound things to say about humankind's place in the universe. Interstellar meanwhile, whilst for sure its sugary effect lingers cloyingly in the brain after leaving the cinema, is a mere annoying dust mote in the eye of space cinema.",Interstellar
1007,Billybobble1,"The things we love most, hurt us the most",6/10,16 February 2020,"I believe Christopher Nolan is possibly the best director around at present, and I love space/science fiction. I try very hard to go into films blind, knowing as little as possible. To say I was looking forward to this is a massive understatement, which probably is why I feel more critical over it than just passing it off as a mediocre movie, it is not.I had to watch it a second time to change my view from abysmal to, okay, it has some merits, but it ain't the story!Honestly I think my highlight to this film is the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer proves once again what a powerhouse he is in creating visual splendour out of sound. An absolute master in his craft.Visually it's also relatively stunning and has some intriguing concepts. Besides this though, I just didn't buy it, it was too unbelievable and all I heard before watching was how it was supposed to be accurate, or as accurate as is perceptible. I appreciate this was a big movie with the aim of appealing to a large audience, but how some of the script has to explain to the audience what is going on was just a massive fail for me and completely took away my immersion.I wanted to like this movie so much, I've tried watching it multiple times, I just don't. It has all the right ingredients for a sumptuous cake but it's like they forgot to put the filling in and it's just sponge, nice sponge, but not a sponge you would later tell your friends about, or post on social media (if that's your thing).I could point out specifics but they would be spoilers and I try to maintain spoiler free reviews. If you are interested in watching I would still very much say yes go for it, there's every chance you may think my review is unfair. I am definitely right about the soundtrack though, that is exceptional.",Interstellar
1008,ahassan-12342,Good outweighs the bad,7/10,23 September 2016,"A film that often had me enthralled, aghast but occasionally with my head in my hands. The film takes place on the juxtaposition between science and sentimentality and it is the latter which is at the heart of the film. The two often worked well hand-in-hand but disappointingly veered towards silliness in its conclusion.I had issues with the pacing of the film, particularly the opening act which dragged a little too long. Matt Damon's appearance was a waste of time and opened up a loophole that one could drive a bus through. The script was clunky at times, explaining what a worm hole is as the ship approaches it is one such example of this. It certainly was able to create an emotional attachment with the characters and overall, I would say the good in this film outweighs the bad.

1010,mazzobr,My tears are timeless,10/10,29 May 2021,"I thought I had watched it years ago when it gets released in 2014. My father had passed away a couple of months before it. I was not in the mood for a very conceptual scientific fiction at that time. So, I dropped it. I remember when I left the hospital aimlessly where he died wanting to travel to space to grab his hand. I knew that for a spirit in another dimension his time would be quite faster than mine based on Einstein's equations. Thus, I calculated roughly how many years he would stay ahead in time from me every single day after his death. Maybe in a couple of weeks, he would have the right to see all his family die too. I now realized 8 years later I dropped Interstellar in the middle of it because I was not prepared to know or maybe just imagine the truth. This film takes advantage of quantum mechanics and relativity theory tied together to cross-pollinate the imagination of all of us, and to ease our longing.

1011,jameskidac,"A very good movie about space, science and other concepts",10/10,17 March 2019,"The director managed to make the insertion into space and science with high concepts of love, moral values and the social construct of a person. That is pretty fascinating, though none of these values were deeply explored, they were considered when dealing with great events that shape consciousness and that is successful for me already. It would have been easy to feel bogged down and overwhelmed by such concepts if done badly, but the director did well to make these stand out to be considered and hopefully that could mean a higher level of thinking for us in the future. Though such stuff is foolhardy to expect from anyone so that is also indicative of our potential greatness if we could make it happen at least often enough to be elevated in our minds.

1014,marshallonfilm_,"""Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.""",9/10,8 April 2020,"Ambitious, loud and sublime, almost to a fault, the 2014 sci-fi epic from blockbuster auteur Christopher Nolan fascinates, and drains, on an emotionally charged three hour odyssey that's sure to leave audiences overwhelmed, just as the writer-director intended. Boldly going where few filmmakers have gone before, Nolan, alongside his longtime writing partner and brother Jonathan, proves he's at his best when interweaving breathtaking landscapes, heart-pumping set pieces and stunning cinematography with affecting character moments, poetic storytelling and poignant themes. Receiving a mixed response from critics when first released, much criticism was thrown at the film's lofty runtime, melodramatic sequences and clunky dialogue, yet these fail to tarnish an otherwise captivating and thought-provoking experience. Soon to be seen in the same pantheon of sci-fi classics from Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott, Earth's finest all turn in fantastic work, such as a superb leading man performance by Matthew McConaughey, strong supporting efforts from Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, and the career-best Hans Zimmer score that slingshots this picture into another dimension.9/10 cold cryostasis cameos.",Interstellar

Maybe i'm just not that smart. I barely understood it and most of it went over my head. I pretty much relied on the synopsis to understand what was going on, and if a film is that hard for me to follow, then it obviously just isn't for me. I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis. I guess if you haven't watched it give it a go, you may enjoy it or like me you might wish that you'd spent the past three hours doing something else...

1016,frezeframe,"Keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better, and BETTER!",8/10,7 November 2014,"""Insomnia"" is one of the top 200 films ever made. ""Inception"" is one of the top 100 films ever made.""Interstellar"" is one of the top 25 films ever made. All of Nolan's films are great. But this is better. This is something else. Granted, Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film ""Gravity."" That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E.T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now ""secret"" NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!",Interstellar
1017,reknob,Awful,5/10,11 March 2015,"I'm supposed to detail my thoughts on the movie here but frankly, I don't know where to begin.There's just so much wrong here that I can't prioritise it all but here goes: Sound: Horrible, horrible noise throughout the film rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible. What on earth were they thinking? Acting: I love McConaughey and he does his best to instil some emotion in here to make up for the total ""care?"" engendered by the pitiful script but he can't do it all on his own and the female lead with the I'm-so-cute big eyes was dreadful throughout.Writing/screenplay: Well, again, I don't know where to begin but as with most poor movies, this is the real culprit here. I'm just not sure at which point I was supposed to actually give a toss about any of the characters or get caught up in what was happening on screen.For a film set in inter-galactic travel, the suggestion is that the sum total of wild and whacky differences between worlds other than ours is that they may have big waves in their seas or it may be really cold. OK, colour my imagination fully filled lol, Jesus wept, that's it? That's the grand vision of the other side of the universe fulfilled is it? Again, this is supposed to be a story of big ideas and concepts so why do we have to sit through half an hour plus of setting up an utterly superfluous bad guy replete with pointless (and hysterically funny - to me at least) fight between guys in space suits? What, if any, was the point of all of that? True or false, this would be a better film with all of the Matt Damon stuff taken out and indeed that entire planet's involvement - mindboggling.I'm not even going to go there on the pseudo-science. I'm a sci-fi fan and I'm happy to let my imagination run to keep myself in the story but you've got to make at least some effort. The complete cr*p coming out of the actor's mouths in much of this film was just embarrassing, so bloody low brow, I imagine the more intelligent amongst them must have had trouble keeping a straight face at times.I haven't had the misfortune to suffer through such atrocious writing since Prometheus and clearly, Nolan is well on the way to becoming the new Ridley Scott. Good with smaller budget films where he may actually put a shift in but appalling when larging it around with big budget ""blockbusters"" sh*te like these - what a complete and utter waste of time, money and talent on films that nobody is ever going to watch again ...Dreadful.",Interstellar
1018,jvg37,Slightly longer than it needed to be.,9/10,11 November 2014,"Interstellar was a fantastic movie. I feel they could have cut about 45 minutes out of it and had an even better film though. As a SCIFI fan, I spotted numerous homages to many other great science fiction films without it feeling ripped off. The acting, script, story and SFX were fantastic, but it was the music score that stood out most to me. The score of this film was as important in setting the mood as some other movie classics like 2001 and Blade Runner.As with most science fiction films, Interstellar requires a suspension of belief as a significant amount of the film is scientifically impossible, but not as obviously so as to distort from the entertainment this film exudes.All in all, Interstellar is not your typical popcorn action fare, it is a deep film with some exciting moments. Yes, it was predictable, but entertaining nonetheless. I highly recommend it.

1019,rubenvanbergen,This is what sci-fi is for,10/10,15 March 2015,"Some people - sadly many movie critics - don't get science fiction. They see it as nothing more than a bunch of techno-babble and futuristic eye-candy designed to pander to the unevolved tastes of schoolboys and grown-up nerds. Superficial, they call it. I say it is they who cannot see past the surface. Like many people, I love sci-fi not for its bling, but for its ability to bring truly epic stories. When you get to use the vastness of space and the intricacies of time travel as plot elements, you can write a story that's simply on another plane. A story that puts mankind and the human condition in a much grander perspective then any other format allows. Of course, sci-fi has just as many bad screenplays and productions as any other genre. It doesn't always work. With Interstellar it resoundingly *does*, however, as Christopher Nolan reveals himself to be a true master of its instruments. He uses space, to show loneliness that only the vastness of the cosmos can inspire, and time, to create an expanse of separation that is heart-wrenching unlike anything that could exist on Earth. As with many of the best sci-fi stories, the driving force behind the plot is the threat mankind's extinction, but it's a threat that is simple, believable and not overplayed. Another hallmark of good science fiction that it displays is the use of good science. Why some critics have chosen this film in particular to pick holes in, I fail to understand. The ideas on which it is based have a firm grounding in theoretical physics (something we likely have Kip Thorne to thank for). Naturally, the film allows itself some freedom to develop these ideas and speculate on the more interesting possibilities that follow from them, but that is where the -fiction suffix comes in. The important thing is that very little of what happens in the movie seems patently impossible given our current knowledge of physics, while the more wildly imaginative elements that it affords itself are scientifically in uncharted territory. This too, is exactly as it should be.The only thing I could fault Interstellar for is the Love-as-a-cosmic-force angle, which is becoming a little trite as a sci-fi/fantasy trope. Fortunately, the plot doesn't lean that heavily on it and it never really bothered me.In short, Interstellar has all the makings of a classic within cinema at large, and as a standard within its genre by which other films will be measured.",Interstellar
1020,holloway-sarahjane,Could have been better,5/10,9 November 2014,"Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive.",Interstellar
1021,nije-mala,I know this feeling...,10/10,19 July 2021,"I felt the same way after watching Gone With The Wind, The Godfather, the Schindler's List. All those masterpieces leave you with a sense of awe, like looking for the first time at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. There's nothing to fill your soul like the supreme piece of art.Interstellar is one such piece.

1022,paulcf-510-910462,"A classic? Nope, more like a Heinz 57 varieties",1/10,9 November 2014,"I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. ""Inception"" was ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn!SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello? No security protocols? It is so unbelievable.Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this story.Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was so silly I couldn't stop laughing!Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly written.Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet. Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock.And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it, it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember 'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to gather dust.So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with decent actors trying to save it.Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something else.",Interstellar
1023,mrsOGB,Thought provoking film,10/10,15 July 2017,"Hubby and I watched a few months ago, and I have been remiss in my reviews. We both really liked this film. It really makes you think about life. I was still thinking about this movie days after watching. Excellent acting, cast, story, and special effects. I'm not great at understanding all the science/physics (whether it be verbiage or theory) so I think they did a great job of helping someone like me visualize and understand what was going on. It is a long movie and slow, but I like these kind of movies and it doesn't bother me.

It's a thought provoking extravaganza that actually makes sense if you pay attention.It's a really long film but it's totally worth it.Right now it is my favorite film of the year.In my opinion, it is superior to last years ""Gravity"".I'll say, ""Interstellar"" is a brilliant thought provoking emotional roller coaster.If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 10 (but of course you already knew that).",Interstellar

1027,bradman1118,"an interesting, original, thought provoking, and visually impressive sci-fi/adventure/thriller",8/10,7 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan has a reputation of psychologically deep, convoluted, and complex thrillers (ie., Inception, Memento, etc.), and Interstellar is no exception.Interstellar takes place in a dystopian future in which the human race has lost the majority of it's resources and must rely on farming for food.As the Earth is slowly dying and the human race is coming to an end, a group of people set out through a wormhole to find a new planet for humans to live on. To say anymore than that would be a spoiler and it is best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. Interstellar is a movie that gradually changes in tone and style as it goes on. The first act is very intriguing and leaves you interested in finding out where the movie is going. It does a good job establishing the dystopia and what it is like for the people on earth. There is also an underlying theme of human drama mostly between a father and his children. The second act takes a drastic turn and becomes a sci-fi adventure with an abstract feel to it. There is suspense, thrills, great visuals and special effects, and an overall very good story that sucks you in. The third and final act of the movie takes an unexpected twist and is one of the most interesting and original things I have ever seen in a movie. Interstellar has a very strong cast; there are great performances from Matthew Mcconaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast as well. There is also a great use of music that helps to build the tension. Interstellar is not perfect; the main flaw being that it is slightly too long. I found the second act and part of the third act to drag on and become too drawn out. I also felt that there were too many story elements happening at once and it became overly bloated at times rather than sticking to the story I was interested in. In conclusion, although slightly too long and bloated, Interstellar is a great psychological thriller that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll. I look forward to seeing it again.",Interstellar
1028,andy-66447,"""Interstellar"" Is Big-Budget Disaster",4/10,24 August 2015,"A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called ""Cloud Atlas."" Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project.Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a ""wormhole"" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another.The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what ""Interstellar"" is all about.After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend ""Interstellar."" But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent ""Gravity,"" ""Interstellar"" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters.Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original ""Star Trek"" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior ""Gravity"" last year, ""Interstellar"" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. ""Gravity"" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. ""Interstellar"" is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious ""Star Wars"" crossed with the garbage science of ""Star Trek."" ""Interstellar"" is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. ""Interstellar"" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two. And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity.",Interstellar
1029,jenjentaro,Stellar at certain parts,8/10,10 June 2016,"I have mixed feelings about this one. The beginning was very slow in order to set up the main theme of this movie, which is about the daughter-father relationship. But it was too slow. They could have cut many of the scenes to speed up the plot.The real cool part starts when they were traveling in outer space and exploring the planets. I especially love to see the concept of space-time relativity in works (that time moves slower in space). Visiting that first planet where they thought waves were mountains was visually stunning.However, the idea of fifth dimension and the concept of future humans were too abstract for me. And I thought that Cooper ended up surviving was too good to be true.Certain parts of the soundtrack I'm not a fan off. The music is too high pitched. I still enjoyed Gravity's visual effects and sound effects more. In conclusion, I was surprised by the family theme and enjoyed the space aspect of the movie but this movie is way too long.",Interstellar
1030,jahn-00325,A heavenly gift for dreamers,10/10,8 October 2017,"Perhaps, the majority of us dreamed of space adventures when being children. Becoming an astronaut, an explorer of other worlds, whose life is extremely different from a common human being's lifestyle, comes across as something heroic. The movie Interstellar by Cristopher Nollan exploits precisely those dreams.Even though starting with the mundane Earth scenes of corn fields, wonderful space music hints the spectators that everything happens in the near future, at the same time giving a keen feeling of an imminent disaster. Events unfold frantically fast and in no time we finally peer to open space and fascinating pictures of the purest emptiness. Overall, the marvellous mix-up of splendid alien music and fabulous views creates magical and, simultaneously, absolutely real atmosphere. In addition, bright talented actors' play supplements the illusion of reality. You crave to believe everything you see. Much more, you are already gradually becoming an integral part of it. It is not only a brave team headed by the Matthew McConaughey's hero and wandering through blackness, it is you who is coming along. This feeling does not abandon the spectator for three long hours, which otherwise might have been a big disadvantage. Needless to say, time goes by too rapidly. Eventually, a sharp perception of an imminent end strikes harshly. You turn out to be sitting merely in the cinema, you are not a hero let alone a cosmonaut and you personally have not revealed the main mystery of the Universe.After all, there is a subtle impression left, which does not leave you for several days; maybe it can even stay with you for the rest of your life. This sensation is of the humankind having a particular mission and an invisible connection of the whole Universe with all of us. Definitely, the Nollan's genius gives us a rare superb gift that can help us divert ourselves from our mundane selfish tiny worlds to feel the greatness around us...and conceive of ourselves as little dreamers again.",Interstellar
1031,MorpheusOne,Overrated & not as good as I thought it was going to be.,4/10,24 July 2021,"This movie had such an expansive amount of hype behind it...how could anything go wrong?!(Cue the Blair Witch Project soundtrack...)By no means was this was the worst movie that I have ever seen, that's definitive; there were, however, a few things about the film that don't make much sense! Perhaps the most obvious among them was WTF was Mann trying to accomplish in his apparent death spiral desire to condemn all life on Earth?! He knew that the mathematics behind 'Plan A' was a fraud; so, he...obviously...believed that returning to Earth was no option. This means that it was his understanding that finding a planet suitable for life, from 'an Earth perspective', was the only viable option. Yet, he knew\believed that the ice planet that he landed on was not suitable for life, faking the data. So, why fake the data?? Would doing so enhance the likelihood of him being rescued? Presumably, yes, since he was transmitting the fake favorable data in hopes that someone would arrive & save him. Yet, he prevented them from doing anything on his world...obviously...because he knew they would uncover his deception. So, given that, what was the plan!? To condemn all life on Earth?! Granted, maybe that's the whole point of that story arc; he was insane. Which is, I believe, rather ironic; that 'death spiral', specifically due to the action of that scene, was, I think, the best scene in the entire film.Something overlooked by, at least, virtually everyone that saw this film, no doubt about it, is: Did the scientists on Earth see the blackhole, ""Gargantuan"", on the Earth-side of the wormhole, obviously, 'before' sending the astronauts through the wormhole, including the 12 sent through initially? It is implied that they did; but, ..& someone, please, correct me if I am wrong, ..no where throughout the first hour, or so, of the film did they bother to mention that blackhole that's on the other side of the wormhole, in that 'galaxy far, far away...' They talked about the 'wormhole'; not the blackhole! If they knew about the blackhole early enough, this, reasonably, may have changed their game-plan. Further, why go down to that planet, in orbit around the blackhole, when the risk of failure is so high, let alone actually retrieving data that is worth the risk of going down to that planet is so excruciatingly, 'astronomically' and exponentially low¿? Especially given the reality that said planet is completely inhospitable...given its close proximity to a blackhole¡!¡ For cryin' out loud, they'd be better off sending down a probe, at least at first, on the same quicker trajectory that they took to get to the planet, to determine if the data can be retrieved; & the data could reasonably be retrieved with just a probe, anyway! And if the time dilation makes all of that not viable, then, it is damn sure not worth sending people down there! It is a story arc that, in theory, sounds great 'script-wise'; because, it adds emotional turmoil for the characters to go through & experience &, therefore, tension & drama for the viewer - yet, it just doesn't honestly work. You see this as a person just watching the movie.I actually feel sorry for Getty, from ""That 70's Show""; while the character is not useless, it is a weak character, entirely because of how the character was introduced, & Topher Grace, as an accomplished actor, deserves better than that. It actually made sense for that character to be a doctor working for/at NASA/NORAD, at the compound, perhaps as the physician working directly with Professor Brand...File that under "" *Duh!* ""; seriously, put that into the '"" *Duh!* "" File'!Obviously, this was a much better way to introduce that character. And, obviously, they chose to not do this; they introduced the character in, pretty much, the worst way possible; dropping him in out of no where, like he fell out of the sky - literally, ..as an after-thought! This was an absolute hatchet job and, undeniably, is the worst thing about the entire film. And, of course, there's the gratuitously predictable 'Tom', a character as devoid of a legitimate reason to exist as any such character has ever existed in the history of cinema! I am actually surprised that they didn't make him an addict of some sort; why not just poor on the vulgar borishness like it's pancake syrup!¿?!And, finally, (astronaut) Brand had a much greater chance of getting back to ""Sol""/""Terra"", our Solar System, than Cooper 'the guy who fell into a black hole...'... But, they can't allow the hero to FAIL; so, they have them accomplish the completely impossible. And the 'Tesseract Scene' is awesome; it looks very cool. However, it only made sense in a 'goofy romanticized sort of way', i.e., 'script-wise', that Cooper was 'the ghost' who started it all... And although there may have been no truly good way, at least none that they were able to think of (Although, did they even try!?), to depict it cinematically, I would love to have seen something of the 5th Dimension beings who made it all possible. When Cooper said that 'we' were them, i.e., ""...they're not beings, they're us."", i.e., that humans are the 5th Dimension beings, that's just more romanticized BS.Overall, the worst thing about this movie is the directing, by far! This movie actually made me lose some degree of respect for Christopher Nolan.",Interstellar

1034,aperisic,The most overrated movie ever,1/10,8 April 2015,"It is not easy to specify the general flaw in this movie, but I will try: the script was simply plotted without any technique applied that belongs to artistry. It is all flat, direct, linear, even though it is a fantasy and even though it speaks about time dilatation, wormholes, other galaxies and so on. When decades pass, there are trillion ways of displaying it. In this movie, there is only one - narration, and only after you understand what narration says a few emotionless flashbacks.Emotional background is missing. There is more emotional canvas painted in any Star Trek episode than this movie. It is so bad that there is nothing to act against.I truly think that the director read the script, took a CGI department to present what the script is talking about, and even this is done fairly unconvincing, and... he expected that to be that - a movie. There is zero effort in combining elements with more depth. The movie is still watchable, but there are far more nuances in some episodes of Twilight Zone. In this one, these are nuisances. It just looks the same, but it is a complete 169 minutes long spelling error.What is extremely surprising is critique that finds this movie far above average, some say a masterpiece, the users on IMDb are placing it among top 50 movies ever. It is not among first 1000, let alone 50.I hope nobody is going to claim that the movies like this one are above average or I will stop visiting theaters for good.I give this movie 2, for the sake of sanity, for the sake of art that movie once was. I hope time will speak against the quality of this movie soon enough.",Interstellar
1035,andyhise,Nolan's my new Spielberg,9/10,10 November 2014,"And so INTERSTELLAR arrived, after spending six years on my IMDb Watchlist, back since it was a Spielberg project.I'd managed to avoid the spoilers. My sci-fi-immune wife Marie and I went in cold, just like we'd done back when INCEPTION came out. We left that one on a high, practically high-fiving, and wouldn't you know it, the same thing happened again. Marie was silent beside me for most of the film, until ** SPOILER ALERT ** the mind-bending scene with the time-distorted, infinite bookshelves ** END SPOILER **. Then she burst out ""That's SO clever!!"" and I knew she was along for the whole ride.Emotionally, it got to me, as I have a young daughter. My man-stare cracked a little at the end, I'll admit. Several times during the film, I thought to myself, hang on, this is actually horrific. Given how I feel about my own daughter, would I do the same? And having done it, how strongly would I want to retrace my steps and scream out no, no, no, no, I didn't mean it??? I felt Cooper's gigantic emotions, and importantly I understood WHY.INTERSTELLAR, like INCEPTION, is an engage-brain movie. If you've avoided the spoilers you will NOT know where it is going, or how - if at all - it is ever going to bring you back. Yes it is spectacular, yes it is a proper science-fiction film which attempts to put hard sci- fi on screen in a way that has almost never been attempted before. Many draw parallels with 2001 of course, but don't forget CONTACT, which also took you through the wormhole to.... somewhere I found entirely magical. INTERSTELLAR doesn't top CONTACT, for me, at least not on first watch. I still think Zemeckis nailed absolutely every heartbeat of CONTACT, and Jodie Foster's impeccable performance in that film aces McConaughey's nevertheless excellent performance in this (and certainly Hathaway's, who I always find a little lightweight and actorly). Ironically, McConaughey's in CONTACT too...I ramble. So does INTERSTELLAR. Its pacing is weird, staccato, jumpy. Don't look for plot holes - there are plenty there, but like with all great movies, I rode over the bumps in Nolan's slipstream, happy to allow more or less anything while I hung on for the hoped- for ending. Did I get it? You'll have to decide for yourself, but it has an ending which I liked.Will it penetrate my top 100? Certainly. It doesn't top Nolan's own THE PRESTIGE, or CONTACT, or SILENT RUNNING, ALIEN, THE ABYSS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, among my favourite sci fi movies. but I'm expecting this to settle well inside my Top 100 once I've had time to process it all.It's up there with INCEPTION - it's cerebral, demanding and thoughtful yet not impenetrable. We both followed it, literally, to another place in the universe. Wonderful ambition, wonderful execution, and staggering to imagine how one might conceive of, and - harder still - execute a movie of this colossal scale. Proof that intelligent life does exist in Hollywood.In around six years, I hope that we get another imaginative, original, stellar Christopher Nolan blockbuster, just like this one. He's still young, and he's my new Spielberg.",Interstellar

The miracle was not because of God or some kind of unknown power. It is ourselves. Humans do not believe in human power. Those unpredictable miracles are regarded as the merits of God.

1039,zbsdeizux,Guantanamo has a new torture method,3/10,28 December 2020,"If I go to hell, they are going to play Christopher Nolan movies on repeat.This is my second - and last - movie of his that I am going to watch.To sum his movies up in a nutshell: they are boring, shallow and a waste of time. A twelve-year-old is capable of writing better stories.The plot (or: which plot?) was unnecessarily drawn out, put an emphasis on special effects, turned unnecessary details into long scenes, forgot to explain important details and had no plot or whatsoever.Not even Topher Grace could save this movie and I love this guy.I can only describe watching this as torture, the highlight was when the movie was over and I felt relief.If the good reviews on here are genuine, people truly lack depth and appreciation for intricate plots, a good story and emotional involvement. All I felt was boredom.",Interstellar
1040,sleons,Overrated and dumb,1/10,16 March 2015,"Don't waste your time watching this film. Every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through. I found fascinating the parallel story that's being told between the main character and his daughter. At some point Nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases. The film is a huge contradiction. And the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is. They are on a mission that's more important than any personal issue, man kind's future depends solely on the success of it. But fø©k that, in this kind of Hollywood bullshit protagonists can't die (just because test audiences don't like that, it makes them really really sad) so against all odds McConaughey makes it back home. Hooray for him, and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending.Mark my words... by the time Matt Damon appears you will be compelled to kick Christopher Nolan right in the balls.I read that they were advised by physicist in order to be ""scientifically accurate"". I'm sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001, event horizon, etc. Interstellar is a cash grab. If you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole. Christopher Nolan might have already had his way with you. My asshole is intact because I torrented this bad boy. Suck on that film industry!",Interstellar
1041,my_anywhere,"Largely Over-hyped, Laboriously Flawed",5/10,13 November 2014,"I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and if Nolan had kept the ""realism"" and tone that the first hour or so promised, I would've been more than happy with this film.Nolan's imagination is impressive, an expansive force that drives many of his movies. However, it is also his downfall in ""Interstellar,"" a film in which he doesn't have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. The plot is littered with points that exist because, well...science. For instance, the characters refer frequently to an equation Michael Cain's character is investigating to solve a ""gravity"" problem. But not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space.Finally, this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me: I feel Nolan is still a very good filmmaker, but this movie glimpses him falling into the same ""black hole"" (see what I did there?) which ensnared M. Night Shyamalan. Because ""Inception"" and his Dark Knight trilogy were such a massive, profound success, he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors' mouths as if it's the most important, mind-altering thing you've ever heard. The movie becomes bogged down with long, dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder, coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. However, these do little more than bloat an already over-long running time that felt like 7 years, but amounted to one Earth hour. The end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable ""twists"" that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal.I will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast, even if their script is not always on par with their talents. As always, Nolan is exceptional with visuals, and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective, albeit borderline overdone with sap. I could've managed without as many repetitions of Dylan Thomas' ""Do not go gentle into that good night."" A beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. A couple times was effective, five times was pretentious.This will not deter me from seeing future Nolan feature presentations, however, it in no way deserves the IMDb ""9"" rating that it has simply because it is Nolan. I can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted, flawed story, but not enough to land the film in any top 250. If this exact film were released under any other filmmaker's name (besides perhaps Spielberg or the like), I can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences.",Interstellar
1042,hemril,"Nothing new, nothing original and below average acting",1/10,14 April 2015,"My real vote would be 3/10. But in light of the over inflated rating of this movie, I want my vote to counterweight this overrating. If you have been watching science fiction since the 1960's, this film will not present you with any new storyline. Over and over we have seen the doomsday scenario where one must find a new world for humanity. There is no contribution to science fiction in this movie. None. Zip. Nada. And the actors? I am an unconditional fan of Anne H. But here, she seems like she has no material to work with. She did the best she could. But no Oscar performance here. Matthew M., on the other hand, makes all efforts necessary to bore us to death. If I could travel through time and space, I would have skipped this movie and gone straight to the end titles. John L., whom I think is among the best actors of his generation, manages to stand his ground and comes out with his dignity of actor intact. However, a bad movie IS a bad movie and in science fiction this kind of mistake can unfortunately pass for acceptable. If you are a fan of the genre, don't bother. I saw a review on the BB saying this is the best movie ever made. My only suggestion to this poster is to start watching what was done before in SciFi.",Interstellar
1043,cbockiii,Excellent Movie,9/10,10 November 2014,"Deep space travel and finding another habitable planet are two of my favorite topics to read about online. I had been keeping up on this movie's development since a year ago. I like Christopher Nolan's movies, even though I always feel like his plots tend to squander some brilliant ideas. The best example was Inception - he could have done so much more with that brilliant premise for a movie. He sort of did it again with Interstellar, there was an opportunity to do much more, but the end product was a highly impressive movie that I really enjoyed. Seeing the visuals of this movie in an IMAX theater is enough enjoyment for the ticket price. But Nolan managed to make the plot worth following as well. He took the plot in a direction that I wasn't crazy about, but I can't really talk about it because it would become a spoiler. I kept thinking during the movie - ""If Nolan would have done this, or taken the movie this way it would have been so much better..."" the same way I said it to myself during Inception. I ended up not being impressed by Inception, but this movie was different. His way was pretty darn good. There were several scenes that had me literally on the edge of my seat. Great suspense. I had a preexisting hatred of Anne Hathaway's acting, but she was actually pretty good in this. She played her part perfectly. I've always been a fan of Wes Bentley and I hope to see him take on some bigger roles now that he's back and recovered from drug abuse. And I don't get why so many people don't like Matthew McConaughey, but he is on some kind of a roll lately with his movies. He was superb in this one, very believable both as an astronaut and as a caring father. I really think he's going to win another Best Actor for this, he was that good. We need more great, serious space exploration / sci-fi films, and this is a terrific start. I really liked the effort by Nolan to make this movie seem real. You could tell that they spent a lot of time with Kip Thorne and incorporated his ideas very well. I know that it's far fetched, but I would really like to see a sequel to this movie. As great a job as Nolan did, I'm already anxious to see more. I think he could do it and I think that with the story he built, it could be even better.",Interstellar
1044,Staffenburgen,"A Celestial Voyage for the Ages, Interstellar is a Flawed Masterpiece",9/10,11 November 2014,"Interstellar defies ordinary description. With its profound narrative differences and unparalleled ambition, comparisons to other films are maddeningly difficult. Taking the viewer on an epic celestial journey, Nolan confidently navigates the physical wonders of our universe. The stunning visuals, chilling score, and gripping story are seamlessly woven together with an impressive devotion to scientific accuracy. Interstellar looks and feels like an honest effort to create a flawless masterpiece. Nolan very nearly succeeds. ""Do not go gentle into that good night.""The film opens at an unspecified point in the near future. The consequences of our unsustainable actions have ravaged Earth, rendering it nearly uninhabitable. As we are introduced to our protagonist, Cooper, we learn that society has regressed to rely on agriculture once again for survival. An engineer in a world of farmers, Cooper is the last of a dying breed. McConaughey is once again in top form, completely captivating the viewer for the entirety of the film. His performance is magnificently diverse, combining the elation of scientific exploration with the emotional dissonance of a heartbroken father. After an enigmatic gravitational force leads him to NASA, Cooper says a tearful goodbye before leaving on his mission to save humanity. With a small team of physicists and intelligent machines, they chart a course for the mysterious wormhole orbiting Saturn. Even this early in the film, I was pleasantly surprised by Nolan's dedication to getting the science right. The planets are massive and stunningly beautiful, space is expansive and hauntingly silent, and most importantly, time is anything but constant, easily manipulated by relative differences in speed and gravity. With smartly written dialogue and a convincing setting, the first act of the movie successfully sets the stage for our intergalactic journey.In addition to McConaughey, the rest of the cast is also excellent. Anne Hathaway in particular shines as Dr. Brand. To be honest, I've never been a fan of her work, but she was perfectly cast for this role. Bill Irwin, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine are also outstanding in their respective roles, providing a solid supporting cast for McConaughey and Hathaway. I also really enjoyed Wes Bentley and David Gyasi as Doyle and Romily, but their characters are sadly underutilized by the film's script. ""Old age should burn and rave at close of day.""The second act focuses on exploring the uncharted galaxy beyond the wormhole. Our team struggles to survive the perils of foreign planets, while also worrying about the mind-bending effects of gravitational time dilation. It is plot devices like this, rooted in theoretical physics, that make Interstellar so unique and exciting. By relying on actual science to craft its story, we end up with a tale that's crazier than anything someone could have otherwise made up. With gorgeous visuals, stellar acting, a beautiful score, and stimulating dialogue, Interstellar's middle act is science-fiction of the highest caliber. After an unexpected and mostly enjoyable cameo from Matt Damon, the film transitions into its final act. Sadly, this is also where Interstellar begins to struggle. As Cooper crashes towards Gargantua's singularity, the writing takes an unfortunate turn. The excellence of the first two acts is replaced by tonal inconsistencies and over-emphasized sentimentality. The unnerving score, so carefully used early in the film, starts to endlessly repeat itself, drowning out the dialogue. Instead of confidently building to an epic conclusion, the film falters. It almost feels like Nolan hesitates, rather than delivering a masterful knockout punch. The end result is a film that, like our understanding of the universe, is imperfect. Despite its flaws, Interstellar is mostly an incredible viewing experience. Superb performances, smart dialogue, and immersive visuals make for a thrilling odyssey through space and time. Save for an unfortunately flawed final act, Interstellar is a masterpiece.I do not think this film will be remembered as the classic it could have been, but Interstellar's colossal ambition is admirable. Nolan aims well past the stars, and even though it wasn't a perfect success, he should at least be commended for that. ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" – Dylan ThomasRATING: 9/10",Interstellar
1045,rick-jatti,amazing,9/10,27 August 2015,"i want to give this a 10/10. i really do. the emotional spectrum of this mind blowing journey with so many moments that just made you feel how much hope means to people, and through the futile journey of loss and longing you can either cling on to that last, flickering hope, or you can just let it go. i loved the main character, coop was such a privilege to watch, and mcconaughey has yet to let me me down. most of the other performances were good, with anne hathaway being as mediocre as ever except in a select few moments, like at the end. i normally don't like space movies, or any movie like gravity, for that matter. they just make me have that feeling of loneliness and despair, because i could not imagine a world in which id want to go into space. but this movie takes that and taps into it so well, especially with the character of dr. mann, who i really couldn't blame for trying to abandon the other astronauts to get home. there are only a couple of reasons i didn't give this a 10/10. it was very confusing, and i consider myself to be a fairly well educated person, and i usually understand complex things. but i had to go to wikipedia towards the end of the movie because i really did not get what was happening. yes, the way they wrote the script was so that they'd explain everything after the whole confusing morse and binary code scene was over, but still. also, it took me a while to try to figure out exactly what dr. mann was trying to do when he attacked coop, because they really didn't mention that they had low fuel until after he died. and i don't think he knew they had low fuel, so why didn't he just tell them that the planet was inhabitable and they could all go home TOGETHER. and lastly, i heard a good amount of this movie's appeal was the visual effects, and i didn't watch interstellar in theaters, rather, i watched it on my laptop so i kind of got to see some of the flaws of the movie without my judgement being partially blinded by the amazing visuals, which were still pretty good on my mac.",Interstellar

Its also trying to be 2001 A Space Odyssey without possessing the artistic quality of that film. For instance, are we supposed to take this film as a serious scientific exploration, or as a film where you can fall into a black hole and communicate through a time loop to your daughter. It cant be both. This film would have simply been better served to be about Matty M giving up his dream of ever coming home and settling on the new planet with the embryos. Instead, thats an afterthought. Then have his daughter still save the planet, get over his death, and on he deathbed receive a message at last that the new planet was colonized.

1048,thependragonscribe,Truly Worth the Wait. Truly a Grand Space Epic.,9/10,6 November 2014,"Truly, the long wait is paid off when expectations vie for the unexpected. That is the handicraft that Aussie writer-director Christopher Nolan has over to his movies. Look at the way he mold the Batman franchise to what would become The Dark Knight trilogy. Trust me on this, even though his style may run to extremes, he is reliable to provide sorrow and spectacle.And to make sure that trust is sealed, I will not spoil any important detail to miss, but I can only say this: CHECK IT OUT.This is one of the grandest films of the year, and it might take patience and observations to keep intact with the story.The basic premise is that the world resorted to an agrarian system, since the planet is labeled uninhabitable and agriculture is being improved to sustain life. And that a functioning NASA program is making attempts to search for a habitable planet beyond the galaxy. Well, the marketing gave glimpse of what would wormholes be, so that will provide a hint.Going to the characters, as the main protagonist Cooper, Matthew McConaughey proved once more he can breathe life to a relatable character, whose entire life revolves to space engineering over the primitive farming. Not bad. But what makes his character compelling is his estranged relationship with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of Breaking Dawn, Part 2) as most of the movie's parts is dedicated to them. The reason I brought up Murph is that her character is the most I rooted for, since she has to live up never to see her father in many years, and that the Lazarus space program might not what it used to be. Lend your eyes on that. And for that I give kudos to Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn, who appeared briefly, on bringing life to the character and giving a compelling father-and-daughter tandem.Other characters and their performers are well in their game. Anne Hathaway as Amelia Brand is unrecognizably excellent, as she fully blends in character. John Lithgow is still a reliable asset. The Endurance crew that includes Wes Bentley's Doyle and David Gyasi's Romilly are decent, despite the small characterization and the fact that the crew has little dynamics. The rest of the supporting players (Casey Affleck, Topher Grace to name a few) are fine. And Michael Caine had poured out his inner dignity to great measure.The only characters that are inanimate are the robots TARS and CASE (voiced by Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart, respectively). Their appearances are a mixed bag since they are mostly set aside, but their designs and purposes are enticing. And visually, they may remind of a Minecraft figure.Speaking of visually, the movie never fails there. It kind of mixes the space realities of Gravity and the charms of Guardians of the Galaxy. But since this is a Nolan flick, it has to be grand, broad and massive- scale. That comes to the visuals of space and the planets the crew arrived on. The Endurance space shuttle design is pretty impressive, recalling 2001: A Space Odyssey. The visuals are worth-deserving to see on the best screen imaginable. Unfortunately, I saw it by the 70mm version, but still, the VFX are indeed a splendor.Indeed, the Nolan-istic visuals are worth the price of admission, if you do not comprehend too much on the script. Leaving the sometimes stiff dialog aside, the story might surface some plot holes, as to how Nolan pulls off his own depiction of time and space. That would come into thinking, once you watched the movie. And it will leave you raising questions about the dimensions in space. Plus more, it will sometimes neglect cosmology, time frames and logic to go bounds to save it for the plot. It is complicated at times, because it is inherently Christopher Nolan. Speaking of Nolan, the movie feels like a passion project for him because all of his usual styles, tropes and uniqueness. The use of time jumps is similar to The Dark Knight trilogy. The non-fixed narrative is inspired from Memento. The existentialist ideas are reminiscent to The Prestige. The swift action, editing and dreamlike set pieces are clearly Inception-based. The expository dialog is a minor nitpick, but the grandness and epic-scale visuals are true to his heart and imagination. With the aid of co-writer and brother Jonathan Nolan, editor Lee Smith, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, vfx supervisor Paul Franklin, composer Hans Zimmer and other collaborators, Christopher Nolan was able to transform a space epic to a compelling humanism picture, without being too egotistical.There is a lot to discuss from Interstellar, but it must be seen first before talked about. Everything is worth investing for a running time of three hours that does not feel exhausted. Nolan, McConaughey and the rest of the cast and crew are at their A-game. Though audiences may feel disoriented with the science of the movie, it is worth needing attention. And though the flaws are way afloat, they never take away the fun. Check Interstellar for it is a true space epic.",Interstellar
1049,fidraisle-1,Maybe spoilers. I'm still watching it as I type.,1/10,11 February 2017,"It could be worse, I suppose. I do appreciate that this is written with science in mind, and with masses of scientific research. Well done there. However, having watched about an hour of watching the film, (and looking at the synopsis here), I have to say, I'm not loving it. The only thing I'm going to enjoy at the end of this is that I can say, ""I've watched it,"" and then the knowledge I never have to watch it again. Don't get me wrong, the science appears to be solid (again, well done, nice to see some one making the effort). But there are a few things that make enjoying this film rather difficult. The constant flash forward of the documentary style memories of earth during this difficult time, and then the flashing back to the...for want of better words ""action"" of the film. I do understand the references to what has happened before the film opens, and well done in the writing, but it's a tad forced, and there are far too many questions that aren't addressed. I think too much is being crammed into the time frame. Having finally watched it, and reached the end I am delighted to say ""I've seen it."" And even more delighted to say ""I never have to watch that again."" There were lots of places that the film could have ended, places that would have made a great deal more sense. There are bits of real science, and then we end up with basically ""some stuff we made up at the last minute.""",Interstellar
1050,quasides,One of the best Movies and still ....,8/10,16 March 2015,"First of many aspect of the Movie are well made and its defiantly worth watching. But it has it really deep scripting flaws and i want to stick with them.So sadly they marketed as scientific accurate movie, well not so much. Yes they got many details right and still have massive flaws that it really hurts. Its really sad because that Movie could have been a timeless masterpiece...So here we go: #1: Radiation. Never mentioned it still our worst enemy in Space. in Fact Its the one problem we cant even imagine how to solve yet while all other problems seem to be solvable in the near future (near like 100 Years). But OK lets ignore that for a moment.#2: The Timeless planet. Well here it becomes nonsense. You can have 2 forms of time dilation. One by speed the other by gravitation. Well you have to know that the Time difference between earth and space (satellite orbit is 0.0000000001 seconds per Day) So in order to have a 7 Years / Hour you would need massive gravitation. More than a planet could hold or a human would survive, more than we would be able to escape with that little ranger#3: exploration of planet next to a black hole. Well simple logic if we don't have much time, no scientist would even bother to look a planets next to a black hole. let gravitation aside and the main problem of a stable orbit of a planet orbiting a sun orbiting a black hole (or no sun if orbiting a black hole) and the massive gravitation forces working on such a planet, the radiation would simply burn everything aways from its surface.simple logic, black holes are very nasty we don't go near them, let alone try to make a living on a planet orbiting one. #4: why not giving cooper one day to prepare his family. they didn't even knew about him hours ago and now he has only a few minutes to prepare his kids that we be gone forever? this is a major part of the storyline and still makes no sense at all.#5: on earth they need big thrusters to escape still on the other planet (with even higher gravity) they easily enter and leave with their rangers#6: air, uhh they found him with almost depleted oxygen. Well but where did he store that much to have enough time to transmit complex data in morse code (which would take endless). still he is breathing and using his tanks so the argument no time in a black hole well doesn't really count does it?#7: all that tech - and still they have to land to find out that there is only water and only ice? no high resolution cams and radar? you don't examine the surface before you land even you have no contact to the guys landed first? Those are the major parts i can think of right now. Most of em are major if not absolute necessary parts of the storyline and its sad to make such unnecessary errors.While i think the idea of trying to understand 5 dimensions in a movie is tempting the end still is a very far and very magical stretch. it just doenst fit a movie which trys to stay technical focused and then drift almost into magicAnd even all of that its still worth watching, many other aspects are done great, Matthew McConaughey and all the ""murphs"" doing great.most scifi movies of the last 20 years have massive logic problems so the movie can survive its own due of lack of competition in that field. it has great visuals and i personally like the fact that they took their 3 hours to build slowly their story. you can even get a glimpse of the political and social implications of the future which is nice.still it leaves the bitter taste of an missed opportunity and an even more bitter by the idea that the last of mankind are only Americans :)",Interstellar

1055,benbhodgson,One to remember,10/10,26 November 2020,"I'm not sure where to beginning, my knowledge of space and science is limited but this film blew me away with the concept of space/time and black holes. I'm actually not sure what to do with myself now!
Left me speechless. Watch this film, left feeling weird and that I hardly know anything about the universe and that there is so so so much more to just the dimensions we see and know of!",Interstellar
1056,jacenknet,A self serving pat,3/10,20 February 2020,"Nolan and Nolan attempt to out stroke off each other by making a movie that just twists so many times and explains nothing that you seriously have to wonder ""why"". And then realize that with unlimited money and ego you can make whatever you want for nobody but yourself. There are so many forced performances, lines, edits, flashbacks/forwards/backs, and timeline overlaps that you wonder if actors where just given sides on the day and told ""trust me, i'll throw it all together and it wont make sense- Isn't that cool!!??"". No Nolan, no.

1058,SvetoslavGrigorov,Interbollo..s,1/10,16 November 2014,"Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.",Interstellar
1059,simplyfsl,A sci-fi love letter to fans by a writer/director who researches and takes his work seriously !!,10/10,7 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan is one of most polarized directors of our generation, most people love his work while others just don't but you have to agree, Mr.Nolan takes his scripts/work seriously, Interstellar is another medal to his list of deep, cerebral and multi-layer movies.The movie is a family drama, sci-fi, mystery, adventure, thriller gelled into a script with a very interesting premise, its not run of the mill sci-fi or apocalyptic movie but again like Nolan's Inception, says many things and will interpret into different layers with multiple viewings. I will just go through the basic plot here and let the viewers get the experience when they watch it, 'The human race is fading after a dust cloud haunts the planet, all the crops are un-growable with the exception of corn, our protagonist is a ex-NASA pilot now turned farmer due to requirements and needs and has 2 children he dearly loves. Due to turn of events which all make sense later, the farmer Cooper is contacted by Nasa who now work secretly to find humans a new home, a new wormhole is the key to a new habitable galaxy and Cooper is to lead a mission to find the new planet where humanity can survive'.More explanation will spoil the experience so that's what the journey is all about.The movie cycles through themes of existence, humanity, family, survival, sacrifice and love knitted masterfully along a sci-fi matrix. Now here I will point out that being a space junkie and following Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan all my life, I really found that Nolan has seriously researched the dynamics of wormholes, black holes and time-space continuum. Its easy to find plot-holes in any script as movies are work of fiction but the script has been carefully crafted and while giving some fictional pay-off, the movie never leaves it sci-fi core, for which I consider it a space movie of our generation, while GRAVITY was good on thrills, INTERSTELLAR will have people google through worm holes, relativity, interstellar travel for long.To the technical details, the movie has excellent visuals and cinematography, it literally puts you in feet of Cooper and his team and you feel the ups and downs they go through, Nolan used more than 1 hour footage of IMAX cameras and it really enhances the experience and is a new benchmark for space movies and their portrayal (along with Gravity). In the acting department, the movie mainly focuses on Matthew McConaughey in the lead role as Cooper and he really scores a home- run here, the emotions of surprise, frustration and the scenes with his family at home and when he receives messages in space are really heart pounding, McConaughey is an actor who has improved and proved his talents in multi-genre and here he adds another dimension to his already impressive CV. The other actors do their job well, Anne Hathaway doesn't have much to do as the film does not have a full fledge heroine, in the supporting role, she does fine and so does Nolans other regulars like Michael Caine. Matt Damon is there and its a new type of role he has done, and he really performs great out of his comfort zone.Jessica Chastain isn't used much and is OK in what screen time she has and so is Cassey Affleck.Concluding the review, I will advise the viewers that don't take criticism for the sake of criticism seriously and do watch this movie, the IMAX theater I saw it was dead silent and full and people came out talking and explaining to their companions the multiple scientific elements the movie possesses, the movie will achieve cult status like Inception and people will gradually realize its complicated circular loop type interpretation with time, but while its in theaters, don't miss it, I hardly watch a movie twice, but the 3 hour masterpiece is compelling me to make another theater booking and go through the experience all over again, its a journey, a saga, you all should experience.",Interstellar
1060,prahladagarwal,A great piece of cinematic experience!,8/10,28 January 2015,"Nolan's latest is an epic science fiction drama on space travel that will make your brain freeze for some time! However, it is marred with a melodrama, Nolan is not a champion of. Earth has lived off its resources and is on brink of collapse, when Cooper (McConaughey) accidentally discovers a gravitational anomaly and lands himself at a secret NASA site, which appears odd altogether. Thereon Cooper sets on a space exploration, with little hopes of returning back. Till the exploration begins, the movie has a curious wait and frankly it stretches too far. The most interesting part is the space exploration with a spectacular imagery, VFX and screenplay. Nolan manages to pull off a highly captivating second half refusing to let us think anything else. The directorial imagination is one of the best which completes a scientist's dilemma's in a fictional manner. The performance and background score makes the movie even more exciting. However, Interstellar misses a 9/10 because of juxtaposing melodrama with science fiction. Hugely inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar does not come close to being a classic like it. Interstellar does makes us feel inspired and bewildered at the scope of mankind imagination and the mysterious cosmos. The concept of 5-dimensional quantum mechanics involving time and gravity has been explained in a remarkable fashion and makes you connected to the plot at all times. Nolan is himself the story-writer of Interstellar. The movie ends in an identical manner to Inception, where two separate stories are intermixed with a thrilling conclusion. Nevertheless, this is truly a great piece of work!",Interstellar
1061,vikascoder,Nolan does an Armageddon,5/10,7 November 2014,"SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore.I don't think even the fanboys can save this one.",Interstellar
1062,user-209-61939,You will have cope with certain Physics mumbo-jumbo ...,6/10,26 December 2014,"Being a movie by Christoper Nolan you can expect a movie to be long and dull paced. And he would never endorse 3D. Still his Inception movie was visually stunning and appealing inspite of not having the 3D.Coming to this movie, this could have been improved a lot in terms of visual effects and could have implemented 3D. But since it is a movie with long duration it is good that this one was without 3D. What makes you sit through entire movie is story that gets interesting with each minute. You will have cope with certain Physics mumbo-jumbo terms which would be difficult to concentrate on and would wish you remote control in theater seek back and forth. The recent best ""space"" themed movie was Gravity and if its still playing in your town watch that instead of this. Though the story concept is different you would be better off watching that than this one. This movie was watchable and enjoyable but I feel it won't be worth for what you pay for.",Interstellar
1063,evanobrien100,Profound and Personal Space Epic,8/10,4 December 2014,"Interstellar is one of the most profound experiences I've ever had in a cinema. I went along for the ride and took a leap of faith, the film asks this of you. It was old school, beautiful, emotional, intense and visually stunning. It was a overwhelming and powerful experience, that's all down to Matthew McConaughey's exceptional ability as an actor. It's strangely much different in tone from what we've seen from Nolan in the past. It isn't nearly as problematic as The Prestige or The Dark Knight Rises either, although both are still great films.I was completely swept away by this extraordinary film. I'm not going to make grandiose absolute statements declaring it a masterpiece, it is a movie you must see for yourself and make up your own mind about.

Only then can you catch all the small details that on first viewing you might miss....the handshake being just one.
Superb acting, incredible visuals and a wonderful score underpin a complex moving and compelling story. Never seen anything like it. An amazing cinematic achievement.

1065,avzwam,More below averageness from Nolan,4/10,16 November 2014,"Once again Nolan basically presents a bunch of sobbing characters to us as good dramatic writing. Who does he think he's kidding? Well, maybe an adolescent audience that likes to praise him using words like ""God"" and ""intelligent"" and maybe even ""superior"".There's one moment where the grandfather of a character I'll refer to as Smurph sticks it to this guy where he says that Smurph who is very INTELLIGENT has made her teachers look like fools and so on. It's obviously designed to appeal to a certain smugness.That aside some action scenes are well shot and designed. The script isn't worthy of them as Interstellar is a film which seems to be made by someone who struggles writing a proper screenplay; Nolan doesn't seem to know what makes any movie any good in the first place.Interstellar doesn't inspire the way good movies do as it isn't an inspired work. It's a product more than a movie.",Interstellar
